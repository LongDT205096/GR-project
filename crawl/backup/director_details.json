    "biography": "Kurt Neumann (5 April 1908, Nuremberg, Germany - 21 August 1958, Los Angeles) was a german Hollywood film director who specialized in science fiction movies in his later career. Neumann came to the US in the early talkie era, hired to direct German language versions of Hollywood films.\n\nOnce he mastered English and established himself as technically proficient in filmmaking, Neumann directed such low-budget programmers as The Big Cage (1932), Secret of the Blue Room (1933) with Paul Lukas and Gloria Stuart, Hold 'Em Navy (1936), It Happened in New Orleans (1936) with child star Bobby Breen, Wide Open Faces (1937) with Joe E. Brown, and Ellery Queen: Master Detective (1939).\n\nNeumann was signed by producer Hal Roach in 1941 to direct a series of \"streamliners\", 45-minute features designed to fill out short double bills. Among these 4-reel comedies were About Face (1942), Brooklyn Orchid (1942), Taxi, Mister? (1943) and Yanks Ahoy (1943).\n\nIn 1945, he joined the company of producer Sol Lesser, who engaged Neumann as coproducer and principal director of the Tarzan series produced by Lesser 1945-1954. The Tarzan films were produced for RKO and starred Johnny Weissmuller and later Gordon Scott.\n\nNeumann became known as a specialist in science fiction movies due to his producing and directing such productions as Rocketship X-M (1950) and The Fly (1958). Neumann directed other sci-fi and horror films such as Kronos (1957) and She-Devil (1957), and directed non-scifi films such as The Ring (1952) an independent feature co-starring Rita Moreno, Carnival Story (1954), Mohawk (1956), and The Deerslayer (1957)\n\nContrary to some published reports, Neumann did not die as a result of suicide, but, rather, from natural causes in Los Angeles on 21 August 1958, shortly after a preview screening of The Fly but before the official premiere. Thus, Neumann never knew what a boxoffice hit The Fly was. He was entombed at Utter McKinley Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kurt Neumann (director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He is the only author to have won the Prix Goncourt under two names. He is considered a major writer of French literature of the second half of the 20th century. He was married to Lesley Blanch, then Jean Seberg.\n\nGary was born Roman Kacew (Yiddish: \u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05df \u05e7\u05e6\u05d1 Roman Katsev, Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0301\u043d \u041b\u0435\u0301\u0439\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u0301\u0446\u0435\u0432, Roman Leibovich Katsev) in Vilnius (at that time in the Russian Empire). In his books and interviews, he presented many different versions of his parents' origins, ancestry, occupation and his own childhood. His mother, Mina Owczy\u0144ska (1879\u20141941), was a Jewish actress from \u0160ven\u010dionys (Svintsy\u00e1n) and his father was a businessman named Arieh-Leib Kacew (1883\u20141942) from Trakai (Trok), also a Lithuanian Jew. The couple broke in 1925 and Arieh-Leib remarried. Gary later claimed that his actual father was the celebrated actor and film star Ivan Mosjoukine, with whom his actress mother had worked and to whom he bore a striking resemblance. Mosjoukine appears in his memoir Promise at Dawn. Deported to central Russia in 1915, they stayed in Moscow until 1920. They later returned to Vilnius, then moved on to Warsaw. When Gary was fourteen, he and his mother emigrated illegally to Nice, France. Converted to Catholicism by his mother, Gary studied law, first in Aix-en-Provence and then in Paris. He learned to pilot an aircraft in the French Air Force in Salon-de-Provence and in Avord Air Base, near Bourges. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Romain Gary\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

His cinema draws from many sources: martial arts, superheroes in \"Mirageman\", or exploitation flicks in \"Mandrill\" or \"Bring me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman\". But these films go beyond mere tribute; They are also due to the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of his country. A reinterpretation of certain elements closer to the Latin American feeling. This is how D\u00edaz Espinoza's universe - one of cool criminals, fierce fighters, and women at arms - becomes one that operates under his own rules, a genre on its own. A talent worth discovering under a flurry of kicks and punches or a hail of bullets.",

He was Visual Effects Supervisor and Second Unit Director on the 2001 Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay action drama Pearl Harbor.\n\nSince his film school days at UCLA Brevig had been fascinated with the potential of 3D for live-action movie production, and he learned everything he could about it. During the production of 1986's Captain EO short for the Disney theme parks he was substantially responsible for supervising the technical aspects of the 3D photography. After several second unit director's assignments in special effects-heavy films like Men in Black and Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, Brevig's previous 3D experience and expertise turned out to be the factor that helped him get his first full-blown director's job when he was offered the chance to direct the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D (a New Line Cinema release), the first narrative feature shot entirely in digital 3-D. He next directed Yogi Bear, another 3-D movie, for Warner Bros., and he is attached to direct a 3-D Korean War drama, 17 Days of Winter, about the 1950 Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 17 Days of Winter, expected to cost $80\u2013100 million, is scheduled to shoot in Korea and New Zealand over the winter of 2010-2011 for 2012 release.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Eric Brevig, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Xu Haofeng was born in Beijing and began to learn Xingyiquan, one of the major \u201cinternal\u201d styles of Chinese martial arts, in 1987. After studying fine arts for five years, he went to the Department of Film Directing in Beijing Film Academy and graduated in 1997. Unlike his peers who were eager to make waves in the newly discovered film market, Xu returned home and studied Taoism and the history of martial arts from two eighty-year-old masters for eight years. In 2006, his publication \"Shiqu de wulin\" (In Search of the Lost Martial Arts World) aroused nationwide attention. He continued to write novels and non-fiction about the ecology of the martial arts sphere in the Republic of China. In 2011, his first film \"The Sword Identity\" had its world premiere at the 68th Venice Film Festival and this marked the reincarnation of the Chinese martial arts film. One year later, his sophomore film \"Judge Archer\" premiered at the 7th Rome Film Festival. Xu insists in presenting unusual values in traditional Chinese culture in an age celebrating outrageous slapstick comedies and restless performing monkeys, and he investigates whether people could live in an alternative way, other than following the conventional circle of life.

Griffith's Fine Arts Studio in 1914, he was cast as Union officer Phil Stoneman in \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915) and as The Rhapsodie in the Babylonian story of \"Intolerance\" (1916). He was also a second-unit director for those films. Promoted to director in 1917, Clifton supervised several successful Fine Arts comedies starring Dorothy Gish while continuing to serve as Griffith's assistant. Their association culminated with the blockbuster \"Way Down East\" (1920). Clifton shot much of its famous \"Rescue from the ice\" sequence and doubled for star Richard Barthelmess in the riskier scenes. He then left Griffith to form his own production company and had a smash hit with \"Down to the Sea in Ships\" (1922), a colorful whaling saga made on location in New England. It made a star of future \"It Girl\" Clara Bow, who appeared as a cross-dressing stowaway. In 1923 Clifton signed a lucrative seven-year contract with Fox and was poised to become one of Hollywood's major directors. Then tragedy struck. He was filming \"The Warrens of Virginia\" in Texas when his lead actress died from burns in an accident on the set. Although Clifton was blameless in the incident, he was fired by Fox and his career never regained its momentum.",

He is known for directing such films as After Darkness (1985), which was nominated for a Golden Bear Award, and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989), as well as for directing the television miniseries The Crusaders (2001). Othenin-Girard is also active in promoting awareness for Down syndrome.\n\nDominique Othenin-Girard was born in 1958 in Le Locle, Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, to French painter Ivan Othenin-Girard and Sonia Calame. His early years were spent traveling to lands that were in culturally different from his native Switzerland; first for an extended stay in Greece and then to live in Iran where his father established the Fine Arts Program in Tehran. At 7 years old he returned to Switzerland with his mother, brother and sister, where he remained until going to the United States as an exchange student when he was 16 years old. He began studying photography and was accepted at the London Film School.\n\nOthenin-Girard graduated from the London Film School with a Masters of Arts in directing and editing. In 1982 he founded his own production company, Dog Productions, to produce, write and direct his first feature film, the psychosocial thriller After Darkness (1984), starring John Hurt with Julian Sands which was nominated for a Golden Bear at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. He continued to direct film for the TSR and British HTV until 1987 when he moved to Los Angeles. Othenin-Girard directed the 1990 horror film Night Angel, and went on to direct and co-write the 1989 slasher film Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.\n\nIn 1990, Othenin-Girard's sister-in-law, who has Down syndrome, moved in with his family. This inspired him to tell the story of a family with a child with Down's syndrome. To accomplish this he founded the production company Alhena Films SA in Los Angeles to co-write and direct the family drama Sandra: c\u2019est la vie (1992). He took this theme up again by co-writing and directing the German television film Florian: Love with All His Heart, which was RTL's highest rated film[citation needed] and received praise from Down syndrome advocate groups.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Othenin-Girard worked in Germany, the US, and Italy, directing films on topics as diverse as organ transplant and action thrillers. During this period one of his major works was The Crusaders, an epic romantic miniseries about the Christian crusaders in the 11th century. He continued producing film for television, for RTS.\n\nAfter 35 years mostly outside his native land he returned to Switzerland in 2010 to direct, co-create and co-write a 4-hour historical docudrama, Les Suisses, chronicling the history of the Swiss Federation from the 14th to the 19th century. The epic story would take three years to complete and was shot French, German, and Italian; it would represent Othenin-Girard's tribute to his homeland. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Dominique Othenin-Girard\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at Cin\u00e9mation Studios. He befriended Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director. They met at an animation festival in Annecy in 1974.\n\nTogether, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean Michel Jarre's Zoolook (together with Caro).\n\nJeunet's films often resonate with the late twentieth century French film movement, cin\u00e9ma du look, and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.\n\nJeunet and Caro's first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.\n\nThey next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children's dreams so that he can live indefinitely.[3] The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.\n\nJeunet directed Am\u00e9lie (2001), starring Audrey Tautou. Am\u00e9lie is the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this film, Jeunet also gained a European Film Award for Best Director.\n\nJeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2'25\" film for Chanel N\u00b0 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Pierre Jeunet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRichard O. Fleischer (December 8, 1916 \u2013 March 25, 2006) was an American film director.\n\nFleischer was born in Brooklyn, the son of Essie (n\u00e9e Goldstein) and animator/producer Max Fleischer. After graduating from Brown University, he went to Yale School of Drama, where he met his future wife, Mary Dickson.\n\nHis film career began in 1942 at the RKO studio, directing shorts, documentaries, and compilations of forgotten silent features.\n\nFleischer moved to Los Angeles and was assigned his first feature, Child of Divorce (1946).  In 1954, he was chosen by Walt Disney (his father's former rival as a cartoon producer) to direct 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea starring Kirk Douglas.  In 1955 Fox signed Fleischer to a long term contract. He would work for that studio for the next fifteen years. His first film under his new contract with Fox was The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Kirk Douglas hired Fleischer to make The Vikings (1958), which was another big hit.  He then moved to Paris where he directed two stories for Darryl F. Zanuck starring Greco. Fleischer then signed a contract with Dino de Laurentiis to make Barabbas (1962).  Back in Hollywood, Richard Zanuck had become head of production at Fox and offered Fleischer Fantastic Voyage (1966). It was a success and resurrected his Hollywood career.  Che! (1969), a biopic of Che Guevera that starred Omar Sharif, was an expensive flop, as was an account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). This was his last film for 20th Century Fox.\n\nFleischer travelled to England, where he directed an acclaimed thriller, 10 Rillington Place. See No Evil (1971) with Mia Farrow was another thriller. In Hollywood, he made The New Centurions (1972). At MGM, he made a science-fiction film, Soylent Green (1973), with Charlton Heston.\n\nHe was reunited with De Laurentiis for the popular, if controversial, Mandingo (1975).  The Prince and the Pauper (1977) was a version of the Mark Twain novel that featured Heston, Harrison and Scott in its cast. Fleischer was then hired on Ashanti (1979), starring Michael Caine, which turned out to be a flop.  Tough Enough (1983) was about the Toughman Contest starring Dennis Quaid. He made three more for de Laurentiis. His final theatrical feature was Million Dollar Mystery (1987).\n\nFleischer was chairman of Fleischer Studios, which today handles the licensing of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown. In June 2005, he released his memoirs of his father's career in Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution.\n\nFleischer's 1993 autobiography, Just Tell Me When to Cry, described his many difficulties with actors, writers and producers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard O.

As the president and key person in the Ottawa, Ontario based Odessa Filmworks production company, he has led the creation of several internationally-shown films such as Harry Knuckles and the Pearl Necklace and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.\n\nDemarbre graduated from St Matthew Catholic High School in Orleans, Ontario in 1990 then graduated from Carleton University's film studies programme. In 1998, his short film trailer martial arts movie spoof Harry Knuckles garnered attention and led to longer form versions featuring the Harry Knuckles character. This led to a debut full-length feature film, Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter which featured many of the actors from the earlier Harry Knuckles films.\n\nPrior to his full-time commitment with Odessa, Demarbre worked for Ottawa's ByTowne Cinema. He is presently programming films for another Ottawa cinema, the Mayfair Theatre.\n\nIn January 2007, Demarbre directed the Odessa's project The Dead Sleep Easy, filmed on location in Mexico and starring Ian Hodgkinson. His movie Smash Cut was released in 2009 after post-production from July 2008.\n\nHe is also host of the weekly Ottawa film talk radio programme Drunken Master Revue on CKCU-FM. He also presents \"Saturday Night Sinema\", which is a monthly showcase of rare or classic cult film prints at the Mayfair Theatre.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Lee Demarbre, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is the founder of Enjoy Movies. In May 2017, Andreasyan left Enjoy Movies studio to start another studio, Bolshoe Kino (Big Movies in Russian). In 2020, the Andreasyan brothers left Bolshoe Kino studio and founded K.B.A. studio.\n\nHis early movies were mostly low-budget comedies. However, since 2015, Sarik began to move towards science fiction, action and dramas. Most of Andreasyan's films were met with negative critical reception in Russian media, according to review aggregators Kritikanstvo and Megacritic. Notable exceptions are the drama Earthquake and anthology film duology Moms, that received more positive reviews. Only two movies by Andreasyan were rated by Rotten Tomatoes, both American Heist and Guardians have a \"rotten\" rating.\n\nHis early comedies, such as The Pregnant ($8.3M Gross), Moms ($7.8M Gross), What Men Do! ($11.3M Gross), were commercial hits. Andreasyan's recent high-budget movies, however, are considered box office bombs, according to various Russian media. This includes American Heist, Mafia: The Game of Survival, and Guardians.\n\nAndreasyan's disaster drama film Earthquake was selected as the Armenian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards,  but was disqualified by the Academy.",

    "biography": "Stuart Rosenberg  was an American film and television director whose notable works included the movies Cool Hand Luke (1967), Voyage of the Damned (1976), The Amityville Horror (1979), and The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984). He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman.\n\nRosenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sara (n\u00e9e Kaminsky) and David Rosenberg. He studied Irish literature at New York University in Manhattan, and began working as an apprentice film editor while in graduate school.\n\nAfter advancing to film editor, he then transitioned into directing with episodes of the syndicated TV series Decoy (1957\u201359). It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the ABC police-detective series Naked City, also shot in New York City. Fifteen episodes of The Untouchables followed, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk's The Trials of O'Brien, among other shows. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.\n\nFollowing the Lutheran-financed U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Germany, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV-movie, Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game before making his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce's chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon's production company, Jalem. Years later, Rosenberg would replace Bob Rafelson on another prison movie, Brubaker (1980) starring Robert Redford.\n\nOther Rosenberg films include The April Fools (1969), with French actress Catherine Deneuve in her American debut opposite Jack Lemmon; the Newman movies WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975); the Walter Matthau police-detective thriller The Laughing Policeman (1973); the Charles Bronson action picture Love and Bullets (1979); and another action movie Let's Get Harry (1986), for which Rosenberg used the Directors Guild of America pseudonym Alan Smithee. He was famous for straight dramas and, especially, crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after 'Cool Hand Luke' was The Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nHe made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute. Among his students were those who would go on to make names for themselves: Todd Field, Darren Aronofsky, Mark Waters, Scott Silver, Doug Ellin and Rob Schmidt.\n\nRosenberg died in 2007 of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at NYU; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director; as well as four grandchildren.\n\nHis students' films The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Alphabet Killer, and The Wrestler that were released in 2008 were dedicated in memory of him.",

Wan is also the founder of Atomic Monster, which has produced film and television projects.\n\nAfter directing the micro-budget film \"Stygian\" (2000), Wan made his professional feature directorial debut with \"Saw\" (2004). The film was a hit and launched a franchise that has grossed more than $1 billion globally. Following a period of setbacks with the underperforming titles \"Dead Silence\" and \"Death Sentence\" (both 2007), Wan returned to commercial success with the PG-13 supernatural horror-fantasy \"Insidious\" (2010), and went on to direct \"Insidious: Part 2\" (2013) and to produce further sequels in the series. In between his two \"Insidious\" projects, Wan directed the more traditional supernatural horror film \"The Conjuring\" (2013), which achieved enormous critical and commercial success and spawned a sprawling set of sequels and spin-offs collectively known as The Conjuring Universe. Wan served as the director of \"The Conjuring 2\" (2016) while producing subsequent films in the franchise such as \"Annabelle\" (2014) and \"The Nun\" (2018). The Conjuring Universe is the second highest-grossing horror franchise at over $2 billion.\n\nOutside of horror, Wan directed \"Furious 7\" (2015), the seventh installment in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise, and the DC Extended Universe superhero film \"Aquaman\" (2018). Both grossed over $1 billion, making Wan the eighth director with two films to reach the milestone. He is the 20th highest-grossing director of all time as of 2021, with his films having grossed over $3.6 billion worldwide.",

Geoff spent years filming around the Globe, and was cinematographer for National Geographics show Drugs inc. Hence Geoff's first-hand experience of interacting with a vast array of people from drug-running motorcycle gangs to Tibetan spiritual masters,Geoff has formulated a unique directing style that, while raw and realistic, is also at times both visceral and transcendent. His real life experiences \"in the trenches\" allows him to create a visual and emotional excursion that is deeply moving, vital and alive. He also films continuously for two time Academy Award winning director Malcolm Clarke. ",

Marshall (December 29, 1891 \u2013 February 17, 1975) was a prolific American actor, screenwriter, producer, film and television director, active through the first six decades of movie history.\n\nRelatively few of Marshall's films are well-known today, with Destry Rides Again, The Sheepman, and How the West Was Won being the biggest exceptions. Marshall co-directed How the West Was Won with John Ford and Henry Hathaway, handling the railroad segment, which featured a celebrated buffalo stampede sequence. While Marshall worked on almost all kinds of films imaginable, he started his career in the early silent period doing mostly Westerns, a genre he never completely abandoned. Later in his career, he was particularly sought after for comedies. He did around half a dozen films each with Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis, and also worked with W.C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Will Rogers and Laurel and Hardy.\n\nFor his contribution to the film industry, George Marshall has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7048 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George  Marshall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

While D'Amato contributed to many different genres (such as the spaghetti western, the war movie, the swashbuckler, the peplum, and the fantasy film), the majority of his films are exploitation-themed pornography, both soft- and hardcore. He is perhaps most well known for his horror film efforts, many of which went on to become cult movies (such as Anthropophagous and Beyond the Darkness), and for his hastily-produced remakes of popular American films (such as the Ator series, based upon the Conan the Barbarian films), some of which were featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000. The poor production value of many of his films, combined with his expressed lack of concern for the production quality of his films as long as they proved profitable, have led him to be labeled as \"The Evil Ed Wood,\" despite D'Amato's apparently amiable nature.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Joe D'Amato, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Her debut feature film, Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015), premiered at Sundance Film Festival. Her second feature film, The Rider (2017), was critically acclaimed and received several accolades including nominations for Independent Spirit Award for Best Film and Best Director.\n\nZhao was born and raised in Beijing, China, to father and stepmother, Chinese actress Song DanDan. Growing up, she was very rebellious, and drawn to influences from Western pop culture. She attended a boarding school in London before moving to Los Angeles to finish high school. Zhao studied at Mount Holyoke College earning a bachelor's degree in political science. She worked odd jobs as a party promoter, in real estate, and bartending before studying film production at New York University Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nIn 2010, Zhao's short film Daughters premiered at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival and won Best Student Live Action Short at the 2010 Palm Springs International ShortFest and Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival.\n\nIn 2015, Zhao directed her first feature film, Songs My Brothers Taught Me. Filmed on location at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, the film depicts the relationship between a Lakota Sioux brother and his younger sister. The film premiered as part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition at Sundance Film Festival. It later played at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Director's Fortnight selection. The film was nominated for Best First Feature at the 31st Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nIn 2017, she directed The Rider, a contemporary western drama which follows a young cowboy's journey to discover himself after a near-fatal accident ends his professional riding career. Similar to her first feature, Zhao utilised a cast of non-actors who lived on the ranch where the film was shot. Zhao's impetus for making the film came when Brady Jandreau - a cowboy whom she met and befriended on the reservation where she shot her first film - suffered a severe head injury when he was thrown off his horse during a rodeo competition. Jandreau later starred in the film playing a fictionalised version of himself as Brady Blackburn. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors' Fortnight selection and won the Art Cinema Award. The film earned her nominations for Best Feature and Best Director at the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards. At the same ceremony, Zhao became the inaugural winner of the Bonnie Award, named after Bonnie Tiburzi, which recognizes a mid-career female director. The film was released on April 13, 2018 by Sony Pictures Classics and was critically acclaimed.\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that Amazon Studios greenlit Zhao's upcoming untitled Bass Reeves biopic, a historical Western about the first black U.S. Deputy Marshal. Zhao is set to direct the film and write the screenplay. In September 2018, Marvel Studios hired her to direct a film based on the Eternals.",

    "biography": "Clinton \"Clint\" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American film actor, director, producer, composer and former politician. Following his breakthrough role on the TV series \"Rawhide\" (1959\u201365), Eastwood starred as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns (\"A Fistful of Dollars,\" \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\") in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films (\"Dirty Harry,\" \"Magnum Force,\" \"The Enforcer,\" \"Sudden Impact,\" and \"The Dead Pool\") during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.\n\nEastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work in the films \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including \"Play Misty for Me\" (1971), \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), \"Pale Rider\" (1985), \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995), and \"Gran Torino\" (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978) and its sequel \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980); despite being widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting for inflation.\n\nEastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as \"Mystic River\" (2003) and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and \"Changeling\" (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.\n\nSince 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married twice. An audiophile, Eastwood is also associated with jazz and has composed and performed pieces in several films along with his eldest son, Kyle Eastwood.\n\nDescription above adapted from the Wikipedia article Clint Eastwood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

It will also be under his tutelage that he will learn the martial arts of the north for more 10 years old. He appears on the big screen in his tenth year for the needs of the movie Squadron 77.\n\nIn 1978, Snake In The Eagle's Shadow hit the box office and Jackie Chan's successor race began. Everyone is trying their luck and Tung Wei is one of those! With his physical abilities that have nothing to envy to the star, one would have thought he was a good candidate for success but it will never concretize really in the eyes of the public. There was only one place and Jackie occupied it too well. The film that sought to sell it as the new prodigy of the Kung Fu movie, showing off these impressive talents: The Incredible Kung Fu Master. Other films allow him, in smaller roles, to show what he is capable of: The Mar's Villa, Golden Mask or Ten Brothers Of Shaolin.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Stephen Tung took a 4 year break away from the big screens to devote himself to television. He works on several TV series from Kung Fu or other Wu Xia, accumulating experience in his new business. Finally, in 1984, he returns to the screens in the first roles with films like Hocus Pocus and Journey Of The Doomed but the films, not very successful, will not allow him to impose himself as an actor of foreground.",

But his real breakthrough was with leading roles in award-winning films The Affair (1998) and City of the Rising Sun (1999). The latter of which earned him the Best Actor award at the prestigious Blue Dragon film awards.\n\nThis was followed by a series of critical hits like Il Mare (2000) and commercial successes including Last Present (2001), The Last Witness (2001), Oh Brothers (2003), and the blockbuster Typhoon (2005). After a brief career slump of flop movies and tv shows, he returned with the critical and commercial hit The Housemaid (2010), which is a remake of the 1960 film of the same name. Since then, he went on to cement himself as one of Korea's biggest movie stars with a string of some of the biggest blockbusters in Korean history including The Thieves (2012), New World (2013), The Face Reader (2013), Assassination (2015), Operation Chromite (2016), and the Along with the Gods films (2017-2018).

    "biography": "William Friedkin (August 29, 1935 - August 7, 2023) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter best known for directing \"The French Connection\" (1971) and \"The Exorcist\" (1973); for the former, he won the Academy Award for Best Director. Some of his other notable films include \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), \"Sorcerer\" (1977), \"Cruising\" (1980), \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), \"Blue Chips\" (1994), \"Jade\" (1995), \"Rules of Engagement\" (2000), \"The Hunted\" (2003), \"Bug\" (2006), and \"Killer Joe\" (2011).\n\nIn 1965, Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, \"Good Times,\" starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley's \"The Boys in the Band\" and most notably \"The Birthday Party,\" based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his \"The French Connection\" was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973's \"The Exorcist,\" based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. \"The Exorcist\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood. In 1973, the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed \"The Conversation\" and Bogdanovich the Henry James adaptation, \"Daisy Miller,\" Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.  Friedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own \"The French Connection\" (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011, Friedkin directed \"Killer Joe,\" a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey. Killer Joe premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.  In April 2013, Friedkin published a memoir, \"The Friedkin Connection.\" He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September.",

Known for their sparse style, dramatic rocky locations near Lone Pine, California, and recurring stories of a lone man seeking vengeance amidst a brutal and abstract landscape, the films have, decades after their release, come to be known as some of the most important Westerns ever made,[citation needed] often compared to the works of existential writers or to narratives from the Old Testament. Until 2008, only Seven Men From Now had received a special edition DVD release, and the remainder of Boetticher's most acclaimed films, including Ride Lonesome, The Tall T, Comanche Station, Decision at Sundown, and Buchanan Rides Alone, which were once unavailable, had a DVD release on November 4, 2008 as the Budd Boetticher Box Set.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article  Budd Boetticher, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Cl\u00e9ment studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1936, he directed his first film, a 20 minute short written and featuring Jacques Tati. Cl\u00e9ment spent the latter part of the 1930s making documentaries in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In 1937, he and archaeologist Jules Barthou were in Yemen making preparations to film a documentary, the first ever of that country and one that includes the only known film image of Imam Yahya. Almost ten years passed before Cl\u00e9ment directed a feature but his French Resistance film, La Bataille du rail (1945), gained much critical and commercial success. From there Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment became one of his country's most successful and respected directors, garnering numerous awards including two films that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the first in 1950 for The Walls of Malapaga (Au-del\u00e0 des grilles) and the second time two years later for Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits). Cl\u00e9ment had international success with several films but his star-studded 1966 epic Is Paris Burning?, written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Paul Graetz was a costly box office failure. Cl\u00e9ment continued to make a few films until his retirement in 1975, including an international success with Rider On The Rain that starred Charles Bronson and Marl\u00e8ne Jobert. In 1984 the French motion picture industry honored his lifetime contribution to film with a special C\u00e9sar Award. Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment died in 1996 and was buried in the local cemetery in Menton on the French Riviera where he had spent his years in retirement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

With Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Pedro Almod\u00f3var, he is considered to be among Spain's great filmmakers. He had a long and prolific career that spanned over half a century, and his films won many international awards.\n\nSaura began his career in 1955 making documentary shorts. He gained international prominence when his first feature-length film premiered at Cannes Film Festival in 1960. Although he started filming as a neorealist, Saura switched to films encoded with metaphors and symbolism in order to get around the Spanish censors. In 1966, he was thrust into the international spotlight when his film The Hunt won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In the following years, he forged an international reputation for his cinematic treatment of emotional and spiritual responses to repressive political conditions.\n\nBy the 1970s, Saura was the best known filmmaker working in Spain. His films employed complex narrative devices and were frequently controversial. He won Special Jury Awards for Cousin Angelica (1973) and Cr\u00eda Cuervos (1975) in Cannes, and he received an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film nomination in 1979 for Mama Turns 100.\n\nIn the 1980s, Saura was in the spotlight for his Flamenco trilogy \u2013 Blood Wedding, Carmen and El amor brujo, in which he combined dramatic content and flamenco dance forms. His work continued to be featured in worldwide competitions and earned numerous awards. He received two nominations for Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film for Carmen (1983) and Tango (1998). His films are sophisticated expression of time and space fusing reality with fantasy, past with present, and memory with hallucination. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Saura concentrated on works uniting music, dance and images.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Carlos Saura, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was nominated twice for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nReynolds was voted the world's number one box office star for five consecutive years (from 1978 to 1982) in the annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, a record he shares with Bing Crosby. After a number of box office failures, Reynolds returned to television, starring in the sitcom Evening Shade (1990\u20131994), which won him a Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. His performance as high-minded pornographer Jack Horner in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Boogie Nights (1997) brought him renewed critical attention, earning him another Golden Globe (for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture), with nominations for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Burt Reynolds, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He later attended a film school designed to give students practical experience and preparation for a career in the film business. He learned the ropes firsthand while working in the camera department on many commercials, music videos, and television shows such as The Adventures of the Black Stallion starring Mickey Rooney.\n\nDuring this time, Elkayem also made several short films with support and financial assistance from the New Zealand government. His big break came with Larger than Life, a 13-minute black-and-white, FX-driven homage to the 1950s Hollywood horror genre, featuring a giant, man-eating spider.\n\nProduced by Academy Award winner Jamie Selkirk, and financed with the largest grant of its kind from the New Zealand Film Commission, Larger than Life received critical acclaim at the 1998 Telluride Film Festival and later caught the eye of the Hollywood producers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow), who then recruited Elkayem to write and direct Eight Legged Freaks, a $30 million feature film based on Larger than Life, starring David Arquette, Kari W\u00fchrer, and Scarlett Johansson, and distributed by Warner Brothers.\n\nHe has since worked on a number of low-budget horror films, including Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis and Return of the Living Dead: Rave from the Grave sequels and has just finished directing Without a Paddle: Nature's Calling.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ellory Elkayem , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, musician, actor, and writer. Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.\n\nMoving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.\n\nProceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990\u20131992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his following films worked on \"dream logic\" non-linear narrative structures, Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) and Inland Empire (2006).\n\nLynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, for his films The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and also received a screenplay Academy Award nomination for The Elephant Man. Lynch has twice won France's C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's top civilian honor, as a Chevalier in 2002 and then an Officier in 2007, while that same year, The Guardian described Lynch as \"the most important director of this era\". Allmovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\", whilst the success of his films have led to him being labelled \"the first popular Surrealist\".",

    "biography": "Andr\u00e9 Hunebelle (1 September 1896 \u2013 27 November 1985) was a French ma\u00eetre verrier (master glassmaker) and film director.\n\nAfter attending polytechnic school for mathematics, he became a decorator, a designer, and then a master glass maker in the mid-1920s (first recorded exhibition PARIS 1927 included piece \"Fruit & Foliage\"). His work is known for its clean lines, which are elegant and singularly strong. He exhibited his own glass in a luxurious store located at 2 Avenue Victor-Emmanuel III, at the roundabout of the Champs \u00c8lys\u00e9es in Paris. Etienne Franckhauser, who also made molds for Lalique and Sabino, made the molds for Hunebelle's glass which was fabricated by the crystal factory in Choisy-le-Roi, France. Hunebelle's store ceased all activity in 1938 prior to World War II.\n\nHunebelle pieces are marked in several ways. The most common is A.HUNEBELLE-FRANCE in molded capitals either within the glass design or on the base. Other pieces are marked simply A.HUNEBELLE. There was also a paper label with A and H superimposed in a stylized manner. Since paper labels are frequently lost, many pieces may appear completely unmarked. In the author's collection there are pieces marked A.HUNEBELLE both with and without the word FRANCE, and a bowl marked MADE IN FRANCE that is identical to one shown in a Hunebelle catalogue. Hunebelle also used a more elaborate maker's mark imprinted on some glass pieces which had the word FRANCE encircled by the words MADE IN FRANCE MODELLE DEPOSE et R COGNEVILLE and with A. HUNEBELLE underneath (reflects mid 1930s partnership with COGNEVILLE).\n\nIn a short essay, he defined his stylistic aims as a glassmaker, explaining that he wanted to be \"an adept of an abstract art where the geometric exactness, the poetry of line, and transparency are combined.\"\n\nHe also patented techniques for producing exact mouldings of items.\n\nHis glasswork displays a calculated modernism in contrast to influences derived from animals, plants and flowers which featured in the work of contemporaries such as Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Pierre D'Avesn and Marius-Ernest Sabino at the time. Hunebelle chose to focus on geometric forms, using technique and his scientific background to enhance light emission as much as possible. Surface contrasts, volume intersections, polished-non polished effects, geometry, light and poetry of line feature prominently in his work. Hunebelle employed both mold-blown and pressed-molded techniques in producing his pieces.\n\nHunebelle was a publisher of a French newspaper called La Flech\u00e9. During World War II, he had no job until a friend Marcel Achard found him work in films for Production Artistique Cin\u00e9matographique (P.A.C.) where he acted as an art director and later began producing films beginning with Le\u00e7on de conduite (1946).

    "biography": "Cecil Blount DeMille was a founder of the Hollywood motion-picture industry, one of the most commercially successful producer-directors of his time, and one of the most influential filmmakers in history. Between 1914 and 1956, he made seventy feature films; all but seven were profitable. Cecil B. DeMille is synonymous with religious epics: The King of Kings, Samson and Delilah, and The Ten Commandments (1956). He blended spectacle, sex, and spellbinding narrative to convey a message of faith.\n\nIt was DeMille who created the image of the omnipotent director, megaphone in hand, wearing boots and a visored cap. DeMille gave Hollywood numerous stars: Wallace Reid, Gloria Swanson, William (\u201cHopalong Cassidy\u201d) Boyd, Claudette Colbert, Robert Preston, Jean Arthur, and Charlton Heston.\n\nDeMille created the posts of studio story editor, art director, and concept artist. He was one of the first to use theatrical lighting on a movie set. In the late 1920s, when Hollywood converted to sound films, DeMille defied the sound experts, liberating the camera from a confining booth, and implementing the microphone boom.\n\nDeMille\u2019s authority extended beyond the confines of his studio. He was a power in aviation, banking, politics, and real estate. In the 1930s, his fame as a filmmaker was surpassed by his fame as a radio star.\n\nHe was a founder of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an institution from which he eventually won two awards. In 1953 his film The Greatest Show on Earth won the Award for Best Picture of 1952; and he was presented with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\n\nDeMille\u2019s influence on world culture is incalculable, but there are estimates and milestones. His biography of Jesus Christ, The King of Kings, was a silent film, but because of a unique distribution arrangement, it was eventually seen by 800 million viewers. Samson and Delilah (1949) and The Ten Commandments (1956) are still listed with the top ten all-time box-office champions. They continue to generate revenue and provoke thought.",

And, we moved to Mexico, from Mexico in '73 I moved to Europe, where I started working in film. I started with Arriflex, the company that makes the cameras. I was there for a year and I did kind of a trainee type of year where I was in the sound department, in the lab, in the studio working with the actual productions and also assembling cameras. And then I moved to Europe, where I lived three years, and then, back in '76, I did my first movie as a camera assistant, which was 21 Hours at Munich. And then, I kept on going, I moved up to focus puller or first AC, and then operating and then DP-ing. And then I was DP-ing commercials and then I started directing commercials in the late 80's and beginning of [the] 90's. I was working with Jan and doing his second unit as a DP while he was a DP He is the one that really gave me the break on Speed 1 to start directing second unit.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alexander Witt, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Jos\u00e9 Giovanni (22 June 1923, Paris, France \u2013 24 April 2004, Lausanne, Switzerland) was the pseudonym of Joseph Damiani, a French writer and film-maker of Corsican origin who became a naturalized Swiss citizen in 1986.\n\nA former collaborationist and criminal who at one time was sentenced to death, Giovanni often drew his inspiration from personal experience or from real gangsters, such as Abel Danos in his 1960 film Classe tous risques, overlooking that they had been members of the French Gestapo. In his films as well as his novels, while praising masculine friendships and advocating the confrontation of the individual against the world, he often championed the underworld but was always careful to hide his own links with the Nazi occupiers of France during World War II.\n\nOf Corsican descent, Joseph Damiani received a good education, studying at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas de Paris and the Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly. His father, a professional gambler who was sentenced to a year in prison for running an illegal casino, owned a hotel in the French Alps in Chamonix. Joseph worked there as a young man and became fascinated by mountain climbing.\n\nFrom April to September 1943 Damiani was a member of Jeunesse et Montagne (Youth and Mountain) in Chamonix, part of the Vichy Government youth movement controlled by Pierre Laval.\n\nIn February 1944 Damiani came to Paris and through his father's friend, the LVF leader Simon Sabiani, he joined Jacques Doriot's fascist French Popular Party (PPF). His maternal uncle, Ange Paul Santolini alias \"Santos\", who ran a restaurant patronized by the Gestapo, and his elder brother, Paul Damiani, a member of the Vichy paramilitary Milice, introduced Joseph into the Pigalle underworld.\n\nIn March 1944 Joseph Damiani went to Marseille where he became a member of the German Schutzkorps (SK), an organization which hunted down Service du travail obligatoire - STO (Compulsory Work Service) dodgers. He served as bodyguard to its Marseille chief and took part in many arrests, often blackmailing his victims.\n\nIn Lyon, in August 1944, posing as a German police officer along with an accomplice (Orloff, a Gestapo agent who was shot for treason at the Liberation), Damiani blackmailed Joseph Gourentzeig and his brother-in-law Georges Edberg, two Jews who were in hiding. Gourentzeig had bribed a member of the Milice - a friend of Damiani\u2019s \u2013 in an attempt to secure his parents' release from a detention camp. They were not freed and Gourentzeig's father, Jacob, was shot by the Germans shortly after, on 21 August 1944, along with 109 Jewish hostages in the Bron (Lyon airport) massacre.\n\nAfter the Liberation in Paris on 18 May 1945, Joseph Damiani, his brother Paul, Georges Accad, a former Gestapo agent, and Jacques M\u00e9nassole, a former member of the Milice wearing a French Army lieutenant's uniform - all posing as Military Intelligence officers - abducted Ha\u00efm Cohen, a wine merchant, accusing him of being a black marketeer. He was tortured until he gave them the key to his safe and a check for 105,000 francs. He was then shot and his body thrown into the Seine. Joseph Damiani cashed the check at Barclay's Bank under the identity of \"Count J. de Montreuil\". ...\n\nSource: Article \"Jos\u00e9 Giovanni\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

He began directing silent movies in 1917 and went on to helm 107 films, 40 of them silent. Although most of Neill's films were for the most part low-budget B-movies, he was known for directing films with meticulously lit scenes with carefully layered shadows that would become the style of film noir in the late 1940s. In fact, his last film, Black Angel (1946), is considered a film noir.\n\nHe was also credited in some works as R. William Neill, Roy W. Neill, and Roy Neill. Neill lived in the United States for most of his career and was a U.S. citizen. He did go to London from 1935 until 1940 where better opportunities existed for American directors. During this period, British film producer Edward Black hired Neill to direct The Lady Vanishes. However, due to delays in production, Black hired Alfred Hitchcock to direct instead.\n\nNeill died in London, England from a heart attack.",

Notable side companies have included Moonbeam Entertainment, Filmonsters, Action Xtreme and Pulsepounders all of which produced films aimed at kids and tweens as well as Torchlight Entertainment and Surrender Cinema which produced soft core films for the adult market. In addition, Monster Island Entertainment produced man in a rubber suit monster movies, Alchemy Entertainment later Big City Pictures created urban horror, and Pulp Fantasy Productions specialized in non Full Moon type horror. For a short time in the early 2000s, Full Moon became Shadow Entertainment when Band felt the company's product had strayed too far from the brand that he had created. During this time, many of the films were produced by J. R. Bookwalter's Tempe Entertainment. Since 2004, Band has taken a more active hand in the company, producing and directing almost every film released. Also in 2004, the Wizard Video line was reintroduced.\n\nFor a short time, fans could buy a line of toys based on characters from the films such as Shrieker, Radu from Subspecies and the Puppet Master puppets as well. Branded Full Moon Toys, this line lasted a couple of years. More recently, the Monster Bra line has been created, specializing in gag brassieres. CD soundtracks have also been released through the Full Moon Records line including many works by Band's brother Richard Band and comics based on Dollman, Puppet Master, Subspecies and Trancers were released through Eternity Comics.",

    "biography": "Spike Lee (born March 20, 1957) is an American filmmaker and actor. He was born Shelton Lee in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature.\n\nHe attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee's next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She's Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million.  Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring.\n\nLee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington.  His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee's handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee's next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March.  His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994).  He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan. He and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, have two children.",

Lundgren's breakthrough came in 1985, when he starred in Rocky IV as the imposing Soviet boxer Ivan Drago. Since then, he has starred in more than 69 films, almost all of them in the action genre.\n\nLundgren received a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in the early 1980s and a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in 1982. He holds the rank of 4th dan black belt in Kyokushin karate and was European champion in 1980\u201381. While in Sydney, he became a bodyguard for Jamaican singer Grace Jones and began a relationship with her. He received a Fulbright scholarship to MIT and moved to Boston. Jones convinced him to leave the university and move to New York City to be with her and begin acting, where, after a short stint as a model and bouncer at the Manhattan nightclub The Limelight, Lundgren got a small debut role as a KGB henchman in the James Bond film A View to a Kill.\n\nAfter appearing in Rocky IV, Lundgren portrayed He-Man in the 1987 science fantasy film Masters of the Universe, Lt. Rachenko in Red Scorpion (1988) and Frank Castle in the 1989 film The Punisher. Throughout the 1990s he appeared in films such as I Come in Peace (1990), Cover Up (1991), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991), Universal Soldier film series (1992, 2009, 2012), Joshua Tree (1993), Pentathlon (1994), Men of War (1994), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), The Shooter (1995), Silent Trigger (1996), The Peacekeeper (1997), and Blackjack (1998). In 2004 he directed his first film, The Defender, and subsequently directed The Mechanik (2005), Missionary Man (2007), Command Performance (2009), and Icarus (2010), also starring in all of them.\n\nAfter a long spell performing in direct-to-video films since 1995, Lundgren returned to Hollywood in 2010 with the role of Gunnar Jensen in The Expendables, alongside Sylvester Stallone and an all-action star cast. He reprised his role in The Expendables 2 (2012) and The Expendables 3 (2014). Also in 2014, he co-starred in Skin Trade, an action thriller about human trafficking he co-wrote and produced. He reprised his role of Ivan Drago in Creed II (2018), and is due to reprise his role as Gunner Jensen in The Expendables 4. He appears in Sharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017), playing the protagonist's son Gil as an adult, and in Aquaman (2018), playing the father of Mera. He also had a recurring role in the fifth season of Arrow.",

Although the TV program was never produced it led the young writer to write screenplays for a number of Batjac films starting with the 1956 film Seven Men from Now.

During that stint, he became known for his deft and original hand at directing promotional films via his own production banner, Biscuit Films (co-run with Shawn Lacy Tessaro); their clients included such brands as Saturn, E*Trade, and FreeAgent.com. In time, Murro and Tessaro migrated to the advertising-based production house Stiefel &amp; Co., in Southern California, then set up a new production banner for themselves. In the years to follow, talk swirled of Murro's pending feature activity -- including, at one point, his plans to direct The Ring Two for DreamWorks (an assignment eventually handled by Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese film) and the black comedy All Families Are Psychotic; however, Murro eventually took his first high-profile feature bow with the 2007 comedy Smart People. The film stars Thomas Haden Church, Dennis Quaid, and Sarah Jessica Parker, and concerns a professor (Quaid) who grapples with a new romance and the doings of a shady brother.",

    "biography": "Raoul Coutard (16 September 1924 \u2013 8 November 2016) was a French cinematographer. He is best known for his connection with the Nouvelle Vague period and particularly for his work with director Jean-Luc Godard. Coutard also shot films for New Wave director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as well as Jacques Demy, a contemporary frequently associated with the movement.\n\nHe shot over 75 films during a career that lasted nearly half a century.\n\nCoutard originally planned to study chemistry, but switched to photography because of the cost of tuition. In 1945, Coutard was sent to participate in the French Indochina War; he lived in Vietnam for the next 11 years, working as a war photographer, eventually becoming a freelancer for Paris Match and Look. In 1956, he was approached to shoot a film by Pierre Schoendoerffer, La Passe du Diable. Coutard had never used a movie camera before, and reportedly agreed to the job because of a misunderstanding (he believed he was being hired to shoot production stills of the film).\n\nCoutard's first work collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard was Godard's first feature, \u00c0 bout de souffle, shot in 1959. He was reportedly \"imposed\" on Godard by producer Georges de Beauregard; the director had already settled on a different cinematographer.\n\nCoutard photographed nearly all of Godard's work in the Nouvelle Vague era (1959 - 1967), with the exception of Masculin, f\u00e9minin; their last work during this period was Week-end (1967), which marked the end of Godard's work as a 'mainstream' filmmaker. The two did not work together again until Passion; their final collaboration was Godard's next feature, Pr\u00e9nom Carmen. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Raoul Coutard\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

    "biography": "Robert Aldrich was an American film director, writer and producer, notable for such films as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Big Knife (1955), What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nBorn in Cranston, Rhode Island, the son of Lora Lawson and newspaper publisher Edward Burgess Aldrich. He was a grandson of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. He studied economics at the University of Virginia.  In 1941, he dropped out of college for a $50-a-week job at RKO Radio Pictures. In doing so, he was also dropped by his family, losing a potential stake in Chase Bank he would have inherited. It's been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich\u2014and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"\n\nHe quickly rose in film production as an assistant director, and worked with Jean Renoir, Abraham Polonsky, Robert Rossen, Joseph Losey and Charlie Chaplin as an assistant on Limelight. He became a television director in the 1950s, directing his first feature film, Big Leaguer, in 1953. During the 1950s, Aldrich directed mostly action films like Apache and Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster.  Aldrich soon gained recognition as an auteur filmmaker, depicting his liberal humanist thematic vision in many genres, in films such as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), a film noir classic, The Big Knife (1955), an adaptation of Clifford Odets's play about Hollywood business, and Attack (1956), a WWII infantry combat film exploring how U.S. Army careerism determined who attacked and who ordered the attack.\n\nIn the 1960s, he directed several commercially successful films, such as the gothic horror stories What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as spiteful sisters and faded child-actresses, Hush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte, with Bette Davis as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane (both Joan Crawford and Davis were to appear, but Crawford left the film); the controversial The Killing of Sister George (1968); and the hugely popular war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nThe success of The Dirty Dozen allowed him to establish his own production studio for some time, but several failures forced his return to conventionally commercial Hollywood films. Nevertheless, his humanism is evident in The Longest Yard (1974), about the rigged-game politics, and Ulzana's Raid (1972) an uncompromising film based on the real life break-out from an Indian reservation of a band led by chief Ulzana, the extreme violence and torture they exacted upon isolated pioneer families in the Arizona territory, and their pursuit by the US cavalry.\n\nFrom his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941\u201365), Robert Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business: Adell, William, Alida and Kelly.  Aldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983 in a Los Angeles hospital.  Film critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: \"He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career. His aggressive and pugnacious film-making style, often crass and crude, but never less than utterly vital and alive, warrants \u2013 and will richly reward \u2013 your immediate attention.\"",

    "place_of_birth": "Roma, Lazio, Italia",
    "biography": "Lamberto Bava was born in Rome, Italy, and was the first of a third generation of Italian filmmakers. His grandfather, Eugenio Bava (1886-1966), was a cameraman and optics effects artist during the early days of Italian silent cinema. His father, Mario Bava (1914-1980), was a legendary cinematographer, special effects designer and director. Lamberto entered the cinema as his father's personal assistant, starting with \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965). Bit by bit he gained experience from his father, who made him the assistant director for most of the rest of his films. He even co-wrote the screenplay for \"Shock\" (1977), Mario's last theatrical film where, in poor health during the shoot, Mario often feigned illness so Lamberto could direct a few scenes, uncredited, to gain further experience.\n\nBoth Lamberto and Mario directed the made-for-TV drama \"I giochi del diavolo: La Venere d'Ille\" (1979). Both worked on the Dario Argento horror flick \"Inferno\" (1980), for which Mario designed some of the color set pieces, including the underwater ballroom, and created all the visual special effects, while Lamberto worked as Argento's assistant director. Late in 1979 Lamberto made his solo directorial debut with \"Macabre\" (1980), a tense drama-horror flick loosely based on a 1977 incident in New Orleans about a woman who keeps her lover's severed head in her freezer. According to Lamberto, the project started by chance when producer Pupi Avati approached him to direct as well as write the screenplay, which took just six weeks to write and direct. \"Macabre\" was released in Italy in February 1980 to mixed reviews, but won him recognition by his father Mario. Just two months later Mario Bava died, and an era in Italian film making came to a close.\n\n\"Macabre\" was not a box-office hit and, as a result, Lamberto went back to assistant directing. He worked with Dario Argento again in 1982 with \"Tenebrae\" (1982). In 1983 Lamberto was offered the opportunity to direct another film, titled \"A Blade in the Dark\" (1983), which was a violent mystery thriller shot in only three weeks on a tight budget and filmed almost entirely in a producer friend's house. Next he directed the action-flick \"Blastfighter\" (1984), which was filmed in the state of Georgia, and immediately afterwards directed the \"Jaws\" (1975)-like thriller \"Devil Fish\" (1984), which was shot in Florida. On both films Lamberto was purely a director for hire and had nothing to do with the script or production end. He used the pseudonym of 'John Old Jr.' for this latter film, which was a tribute to his father Mario, who often used the pseudonym 'John M. Old'.  He enjoyed his best commercial success to date with \"Demons\" (1985), produced by Dario Argento, co-written by Dardano Sacchetti and filmed in West Berlin. This film's international success allowed him to co-write, produce and direct a sequel, \"Demons 2\" (1986). Lamberto returned to giallo thrillers with \"Delirium\" (1987).\n\nIn the late 1980s the Italian cinema turned moribund. Lamberto, like most of his colleagues, turned to making films for Italian television. He also directed a remake of his father's \"Black Sunday\" (1960), which was titled \"La maschera del demonio\" (1990).\n\nNowadays Lamberto Bava continues to divide his time between TV work and a few movies, acknowledging his inspiration from his late father, Mario.",

    "biography": "Edward Dmytryk (September 4, 1908 \u2013 July 1, 1999) was an American film director who was amongst the Hollywood Ten, a group of blacklisted film industry professionals who served time in prison for being in contempt of Congress during the McCarthy-era 'red scare'.\n\nAlthough born in Grand Forks, British Columbia, Canada, Dmytryk grew up in San Francisco when his Ukrainian parents moved to the United States. At the age of 31, he became a naturalized citizen.\n\nHis best known films from the pre-McCarthy period of his career were film noirs Crossfire, for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and Murder, My Sweet, the latter an adaptation of Raymond Chandler's Farewell My Lovely. In addition, he made two World War II films: Hitler's Children, the story of the Hitler youth and Back to Bataan starring John Wayne.\n\nThe late 1940's was the time of the Second Red Scare, and Dmytryk was one of many filmmakers investigated. Summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he refused to cooperate and was sent to jail. After spending several months behind bars, Dmytryk made the decision to testify again, and give the names of his fellow members in the American Communist Party as the HUAC had demanded. On April 25, 1951, Dmytryk appeared before HUAC for the second time, answering all questions. He spoke of his own Party past, a very brief membership in 1945, including the naming of twenty-six former members of left-wing groups. He explained how John Howard Lawson, Adrian Scott, Albert Maltz and others had pressured him to include communist propaganda in his films. His testimony damaged several court cases that others of the so-called \"Hollywood 10\" had filed. He recounted his experiences of the period in his revealing 1996 book, Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten (Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL).\n\nFor a time, Dmytryk moved to England, and Stanley Kramer hired him to direct a trio of low-budget films before handing Dmytryk The Caine Mutiny. He made films for major studios Columbia, 20th Century Fox, MGM and Paramount Pictures, including, among others, Raintree County, The Left Hand of God, The Young Lions, a remake of the Marlene Dietrich classic The Blue Angel, and The Carpetbaggers. Later into the 60' and 70's, he directed Where Love Has Gone, Anzio, Alvarez Kelly, Shalako, and his final film Bluebeard. The films which he directed featured stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, Gene Tierney, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda.\n\nAfter his film career tapered off in the 1970s, he entered academia and taught at the University of Texas at Austin, and at the University of Southern California. He wrote several books on the art of filmmaking (such as \"On Film Editing\") and lectured at various colleges and theaters, such as the Orson Welles Cinema. Dmytryk died from heart and kidney failure on 1 July, 1999, aged 90, in Encino, California.",

His films are renowned by film enthusiasts worldwide for their jarring visual style, irreverent humour, nihilistic cool and entertainment-over-logic sensibility. He made 40 predominately B-movies for the Nikkatsu Company between 1956 and 1967, working most prolifically in the yakuza genre. His increasingly surreal style began to draw the ire of the studio in 1963 and culminated in his ultimate dismissal for what is now regarded his magnum opus, Branded to Kill (1967), starring notable collaborator Joe Shishido. Suzuki successfully sued the studio for wrongful dismissal, but he was blacklisted for 10 years after that. As an independent filmmaker, he won critical acclaim and a Japanese Academy Award for his Taish\u014d Trilogy, Zigeunerweisen (1980), Kagero-za (1981) and Yumeji (1991).\n\nHis films remained widely unknown outside of Japan until a series of theatrical retrospectives beginning in the mid 1980s, home video releases of key films such as Branded to Kill and Tokyo Drifter in the late 1990s and tributes by such acclaimed filmmakers as Jim Jarmusch, Takeshi Kitano, Wong Kar-wai and Quentin Tarantino signaled his international discovery. Suzuki has continued making films, albeit sporadically. In Japan, he is more commonly recognized as an actor for his numerous roles in Japanese films and television.\n\nHe passed away on February 13th, 2017.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Seijun Suzuki, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for 10, winning 4.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his \"strong direction of actors\", \"vigorous storytelling\" and the \"social realism\" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been \"one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.\" Lumet was also known as an \"actor's director,\" having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than \"any other director.\"\n\nLumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his \"brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture.\" Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sidney Lumet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Also Franck, as a cinematographer, helped journalist Mouloud Achour make reports for MTV.\n\nIn 2009, he made a mini-series Ka\u00efra Shopping, a satiric take on a television newsreel. The series was shot on a low budget, in a clip-art manner. Thanks to the success on the Internet, the actors of the series Franck Gastambide, Medi Sadoun and Zib Pokti, were invited by Ramzi Bedia to make a cameo in his movie Bacon on the Side. The series was released on the air on Canal+, and then extended for another three seasons.\n\nAfter that, Frank Gastambide signed a contract with the company Mandarin Cin\u00e9ma (known for its pictures OSS 117, Brice de Nice, Potiche, The Conquest) for his directorial debut, in which the characters of Ka\u00efra Shopping were supposed to be used. The consent to the shooting in the debut picture of Gastambide was given by such stars as Ramzi Bedia, Fran\u00e7ois Damiens, Eric Cantona, \u00c9lie Semoun, Alex Lutz and Alice Bela\u00efdi, rappers Mafia K'1 Fry, Katsuni and Cut Killer. This was the first time when a full-length film was shot based on a web-show.\n\nDistributor of the film, entitled Porn in the Hood, became the company Gaumont, and it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was released on 11 July 2012, quickly gaining recognition from both critics and the public. The film was watched by more than a million viewers. That allowed it to become the most profitable French film in 2012.\n\nFor the picture Porn in the Hood, Gastambide received the Prize for the first best film of the magazine Le Film fran\u00e7ais along with Ramzi Bedia, Alice Belaidi and the producers Eric and Nicolas Altmayer.\n\nOn 22 February 2013 Gastambide, together with Sadoun and Pokti, hosted the ceremony for the French C\u00e9sar film awards, presenting prizes for the best sound and the best picture. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Franck Gastambide\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

    "biography": "London-raised French director of cinema and television, Yann Demange, is of Algerian and French ancestry. Following the success of his television shows Dead Set (2008) and Top Boy (2011), he made his feature film directing debut in 2014 with the highly regarded indie film '71', for which he won the British Independent Film Award for Best Director.\n\nDemange, whose parents were Algerian and French, was born in Paris. When he was two years old, his mother and two elder half-brothers relocated to London, first to the south and later to the west of the city. Demange was reared in two four-year foster care placements in Essex between the ages of four and twelve, one with a French-speaking family and the other with a white Cockney family. His parents separated soon after the family relocated to London. His first name was originally Mounir, but after his parents divorced, one of his half-brothers persuaded his mother to alter it to Yann, and Mounir became his middle name. This allowed him to avoid prejudice due to his Arabic name. Demange, a French citizen, has stated that he mostly identifies as a Londoner and does not have a distinct sense of national identification.\n\nBefore the nation's civil war broke out in the summer of 1991, he flew to Algeria to see his extended relatives. It was on this journey that he first saw The Battle of Algiers, a movie in which Demange's aunt made an appearance as one of the numerous uncredited performers. He claimed that learning about his aunt's part in the movie deepened his appreciation for it. \"As absurd as it sounds, on some level, I think I felt like I had discovered an inheritance to some sort of personal lineage in films.\" At the age of eighteen, he started working as a runner on music video sets before enrolling at the London College of Printing's arts foundation. Later, he produced observational films for General Electric.\n\nDisney provided a scholarship for Demange to attend the National Film and Television School while he was in his late 20s. Based on his graduation film, he landed a partnership with ICM Partners, leading to his directing many episodes of the TV show Secret Diary of a Call Girl (2007). After that, he directed the 2008 zombie horror series Dead Set, which received a BAFTA Television Award nomination for Best Drama Serial. Demange was nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Director for his work directing Channel 4's Top Boy (2011), a gang drama set in Hackney. The serial was also nominated for Best Mini-Series. \n\nIn 2014, Demange made his feature film directing debut with '71,' starring Jack O'Connell as a soldier sent to Belfast during the height of political unrest in Northern Ireland. '71 had its Berlin International Film Festival competitive premiere and went on to win praise from critics. In addition to being nominated for a BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer, Demange also received the British Independent Film Award for Best Director. Additionally, Demange has been praised as a bright emerging talent in British cinema. \n\nHis latest project is directing Marvel Studios' Blade (2025), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

Haller studied at the renowned Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1953, Haller started as an art director in television, then quickly graduated to low budget feature films. Among many other credits, Haller designed the deceptively opulent sets for nearly all of Roger Corman's critically acclaimed Edgar Allan Poe film series, including House of Usher (1960) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961).\n\nHaller directed his first film, Die, Monster, Die!, in 1965 for American International Pictures. Based on H. P. Lovecraft's short story The Colour Out of Space, it was very similar in plot and atmosphere to Corman's Poe films. After directing two motorcycle pictures (The Devil's Angels (1967) and The Wild Racers (1968)), Haller filmed another Lovecraft adaptation, The Dunwich Horror (1970).\n\nFrom 1972, all of Haller's subsequent work has been in television, including directing episodes of Night Gallery, Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Today he lives with his family in a horse ranch in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Daniel Haller, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Passer attended King George boarding school in Pod\u011bbrady with future filmmakers Milo\u0161 Forman, Jerzy Skolimowski and Paul Fierlinger and statesman V\u00e1clav Havel. He then studied at FAMU in Prague, but did not finish the course. He began his career as an assistant director on Ladislav Helge's Velk\u00e1 samota.\n\nLater he collaborated with his friend Forman on all of Forman's Czech films, including Loves of a Blonde (1965) and The Firemen's Ball (1967), both of which Passer co-wrote and which were nominated for Academy Awards. He introduced Forman to cinematographer Miroslav Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek whom he knew from Velk\u00e1 samota. He then directed his first feature, Intimate Lighting, which was released in 1965 and is considered by some to be Passer's masterpiece.\n\nIn 1969, after the Warsaw Pact invasion, Passer and Forman left Czechoslovakia together. Both proceeded to the United States, with Forman becoming an Academy Award-winning filmmaker. Passer went on to make several prominent American films such as Born to Win (1971), a junkie drama starring George Segal and Karen Black, and Cutter's Way (1981), a dramatic thriller starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard.\n\nThough best known for his idiosyncratic, often gritty dramas, he also directed comedies such as Silver Bears (1978) starring Michael Caine and Creator (1985) starring Peter O'Toole. Later in his career, he directed numerous films for television, most notably the award-winning biopic Stalin (1992) starring Robert Duvall for HBO. He was also a film professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nPasser died on January 9, 2020 from pulmonary complications in Reno, Nevada.

At the time that he first watched the 1974 film \"Chinatown,\" set in the year 1937, Eubank was unaware that it was a period piece, assuming it to have been made contemporaneously in 1937. When he found out it had been made almost four decades after the era it depicted, Eubank came to a realization about film's power.\n\nEubank drew significant inspiration from his grandfather, a US Navy cinematographer. From the stories he would tell \u2013 one involved operating a camera while flying underneath the Golden Gate Bridge \u2013 Eubank decided he wanted to either serve in the US Navy or pursue a career in film.

He began working at Panavision Woodland Hills as a camera repair technician and digital imaging technician and describes his eight years at Panavision as serving as his film school.

    "biography": "Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille Fran\u00e7ois van Varenberg in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, to Eliana and Eug\u00e8ne van Varenberg, an accountant. \u201cThe Muscles from Brussels\u201d started martial arts at the age of eleven. His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association's middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels.\n\nIn 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels, Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) kickboxing record, and a semi-contact record of 41-4.  He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981, van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. In 1984, he got his first significant role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie, No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). The movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if van Damme did not help them to re-cut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the US shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a US box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star, Jean-Claude van Damme.\n\nHis good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), AWOL: Absent Without Leave (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office: The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999, he remarried his ex-wife, Gladys Portugues, and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family, he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Derailed (2002), and In Hell (2003).",

A long running production partnership with Roger Corman assured proper distribution of his movies in the USA.

After studying film in London, he became assistant director to Otto Preminger on Exodus (1960), Leon Uris's epic about the birth of Israel. Thereafter he worked on Zorba the Greek (1964), in which Cosmatos had a small part as Boy with Acne. Cosmatos grew up in Egypt and Cyprus and is said to have spoken six languages. He was famous in Italy for the movies Rappresaglia (1973) with Marcello Mastroianni and The Cassandra Crossing (1976) with Sophia Loren. In 1979, he made the famous and successful World War II adventure movie Escape to Athena, starring a gigantic all star cast including Roger Moore, David Niven, Telly Savalas, Elliot Gould and Claudia Cardinale. Cosmatos was nominated for a 1985 Golden Raspberry Award for his role as director of Rambo: First Blood Part II starring Sylvester Stallone. He also directed another Stallone vehicle, Cobra, in 1986.\n\nLate in his career, Cosmatos received more praise for Tombstone, a 1993 Western movie about Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. This film was particularly praised for the exceptional performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. After his death it was revealed by Tombstone star Kurt Russell that Cosmatos had ghost-directed the movie on Russell's behalf. Sylvester Stallone recommended Cosmatos after the departure of the first director, and informed Russell that Cosmatos had also ghost-directed Rambo: First Blood Part II on Stallone's behalf.[1]\n\nGeorge P.

However, after the positive response of the audience, he continued his show to attract larger crowds in Besiktas Cultural Center where he has appeared in over a thousand stand-up comedy shows since, becoming so popular that tickets have sold for 250TL (approx.

He achieved his greatest success by starring in and writing big-budget science-fiction parody G.O.R.A. (2004), also directed by \u00d6mer Faruk Sorak, which despite spending several years in production because of financial and other technical problems became a box-office hit and described by Rekin Teksoy as a strong sign that showed that popular cinema was successful in appealing to wide audiences. He maintained this success with a starring role in the comedy feature movie Magic Carpet Ride (2005) AKA 'Magic Carpet Ride', also directed by Yilmaz Erdogan, for which he won Best Supporting Actor at the 11th Sadri Alisik Awards, and his directorial debut with The Magician (2006), co-directed by Ali Taner Baltaci, for which he won Best Actor at the 34th Brussels International Independent Film Festival and 12th Sadri Alisik Awards.

He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller,\" having begun his career at the peak of the Cold War. Many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.\n\nMovie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment\u2014things that were facing us all.\" Among his credits were The Manchurian Candidate (1962), Birdman of Alcatraz (also 1962), The Train, (1964), Seven Days in May (also 1964) and Ronin (1998).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Frankenheimer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He often works under pseudonyms such as \"Jay Andrews,\" \"Arch Stanton,\" \"H.R.

A character in the film The Final Destination is named after him.\n\nIn 2009, the documentary Popatopolis, directed by Clay Westervelt and named for one of Wynorski's pseudonyms, chronicled Wynorski during the making of his soft-core horror film, The Witches of Breastwick. The film serves as a partial biography, with clips from many of his previous films and includes interviews with Wynorski, his contemporaries, cast, and crew.\n\nIn 2016, he directed Nessie & Me, the character Jack O\u2019Grady directly references Wynorski's earlier films Dinocroc vs. Supergator and Piranhaconda when he encounters Nessie at the start of the film, hinting that Nessie & Me is canon to those film series, as well as Monster Cruise, with many characters from it appearing in Nessie & Me as well.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jim Wynorski, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He kept it as his stage name once the war was over.\n\nHis sparse, existentialist but stylish approach to film noir and later neo-noir films, many of them in the crime dramas, have been highly influential to future generations of filmmakers.

His breakthrough was directing Lorraine Hansberry's To Be Young, Gifted and Black, which he restaged for television in 1972.\n\nSchultz' earliest film projects combined low comedy with profound social comment (Honeybaby, Honeybaby and Cooley High), reaching a peak with the ensemble comedy Car Wash (1976) and Which Way Is Up? (1977), starring Richard Pryor.\n\nIn 1978, Schultz took the reins of the musical Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with the largest budget ever entrusted to an African-American film director to that date. However, upon its release, the project was a commercial and critical failure. Schultz would go on to make prominent films such as Scavenger Hunt (1979), Carbon Copy (1981), and Disorderlies (1987).\n\nMore recently, Schultz has worked in television, piloting episodes of such style-conscious series as The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and Picket Fences, as well as an abundance of made-for-TV movies.\n\nIn 1991, Schultz was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.",

While much of his directorial output is routine, there are some real gems scattered throughout. My Friend Flicka (1943) is a beautiful, serene tale of a boy and a spectacular horse and was a major success in its day. Although typed as an \"outdoors\" director, Schuster could turn out tough, gritty little thrillers when he wanted to, such as Loophole (1954), about a bank teller who gets framed for an embezzlement; it ranks right up there with the edgy crime dramas of Don Siegel and Phil Karlson. Schuster's western Dragoon Wells Massacre (1957), despite its potboiler title, is a sharp, well-paced effort about two disparate groups of travelers who must band together to fight off rampaging Indians. Good writing, a rousing score and Schuster's tight direction raise this several notches above the product normally churned out by its studio, the usually low-grade Allied Artists. Schuster eventually turned to series television, and finished out his career there.",

    "biography": "Jonathan Liebesman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 15, 1976. He would remain in his home country, studying filmmaking at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance, until 1996; that year, he traveled to New York City to visit his cousin who was attending New York University. Soon after the visit, Jonathan enrolled at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nFor his student first film, Jonathan turned Roald Dahl's short story Genesis and Catastrophe (2000) into a 8-minute, award-winning short that help him land Hollywood representation; accolades included the 2000 Hollywood Film Festival's Young Filmmaker Award and the Austin Film Festival's Student Short Film Award.\n\nJonathan would make his feature-film debut in 2002 with Darkness Falls (2003), a dark twist on the Tooth Fairy tale that opened at #1 at the box office despite being critically panned. It also served as the big-screen debut for Emma Caulfield Ford, long a fan-favorite as Anya Jenkins on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).\n\nRings (2005), his short film that connected The Ring (2002) and its sequel, was first released as a bonus disc with the re-release of The Ring on DVD. The short caught the attention of Michael Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes, and soon Jonathan was installed as the director of the company's project The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006), a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), the widely successful remake of the original.\n\nInitially announced as the director of the Friday the 13th reboot, Jonathan's next feature would instead be The Killing Room (2009) with Peter Stormare, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Clea DuVall, Timothy Hutton, Nick Cannon and Shea Whigham. The psychological thriller played the festival circuit before being released on DVD in the United States.\n\nA few months before The Killing Room's Sundance world premiere in January 2009, Jonathan was announced as the director of Battle Los Angeles (2011), an alien-invasion film starring Aaron Eckhart and released by Columbia Pictures. The sci-fi/action film was a worldwide hit and put Jonathan in the running for a handful of big-studio pictures.\n\nBefore Battle LA's release, he had handed the job of directing Odysseus as Warner Bros., though that project remains in development at this time. Instead, Jonathan took the reins for Wrath of the Titans (2012), the sequel to successful but maligned Clash of the Titans (2010).",

    "biography": "John Marcellus Huston (August 5, 1906 \u2013 August 28, 1987) was an American film director, screenwriter, actor, and visual artist. He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Misfits (1961), Fat City (1972), The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Prizzi's Honor (1985).\n\nIn his early years, Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris. He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an \"heroic quest,\" as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming \"destructive alliances,\" giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war.\n\nHuston has been referred to as \"a titan\", \"a rebel\", and a \"renaissance man\" in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as \"cinema's Ernest Hemingway\"\u2014a filmmaker who was \"never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.\" During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice. He directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Huston, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nDavid \"Dave\" Fleischer (July 14, 1894 \u2013 June 25, 1979) was an American animator film director and film producer, best known as a co-owner of Fleischer Studios with his older brother Max Fleischer. He was a native of New York City.\n\nSometime around 1913-1914, Dave began working as a film cutter for the American branch of Path\u00e9, the French company that was the world's largest film production and distribution company, and the largest manufacturer of film equipment, in the first decades of the 20th Century.\n\nDave Fleischer was notable during the brothers' early days as the rotoscope model for their first character, Koko the Clown. He went on to become director and later producer of the studio's output. Although he is credited as \"director\" of every film released by the Fleischer studio from 1921 to 1942, the lead animators actually performed directorial duties, and Fleischer mainly served as producer. Among the cartoon series Fleischer supervised during this period were Talkartoons, Betty Boop Cartoons, Popeye the Sailor, Color Classics and several others; Popeye would go on to be the top rival of Mickey Mouse. He also supervised two animated features released through Paramount Pictures, Gulliver's Travels (1939) and Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941). The debt Fleischer Studios owed to Paramount for the budgets of those features, worsened by the lack of success that came from the studio's non-Popeye cartoons, was called in by Paramount; this forced the brothers to give the studio to Paramount on May 24, 1941. However, both were still able to remain in charge of Fleischer Studios for a time.\n\nFleischer was asked by Paramount to put the popular comic book hero Superman into a cartoon series. The big-budget Superman series became the most successful cartoon of the late period of Fleischer Studios. However, relations between Dave and Max were deteriorating. The feud starting simmering after the married Dave began an adulterous affair with his Miami secretary in 1938, and was followed by more personal and professional disputes.\n\nIn April 1942 Fleischer, no longer able to cooperate with his brother, left the company to become President of Screen Gems at Columbia Pictures, although he remained co-manager of Fleischer Studios until Paramount reorganized the studio in May 1942 after Max and Dave's contracts expired. Now owned wholly by Paramount, the studio was re-organized as Famous Studios, although the name wasn't officially adopted until May 1943.\n\nIn the late-1940s, Fleischer moved over to Universal, where he became a special effects expert and general problem-solver, working on films such as Francis (1950), The Birds (1963), and Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967).\n\nFleischer died of a stroke on June 25, 1979 in Woodland Hills, California, having spent over a decade in retirement.",

It told the story of Bill Miner, Canada's first train robber and starred Richard Farnsworth.\n\nHe followed that success with The Mean Season (1985) and One Magic Christmas (1985). Production problems dogged his biopic Bethune: The Making of a Hero (1990) which starred Donald Sutherland as Dr. Norman Bethune. His final film Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog was produced in 1994. During the same time he was diagnosed with leukemia.

Show, One Potato, Two Potato (1964), The Other Side of the Mountain (1975), and Oscar nominee Two-Minute Warning (1976).\n\nThe son of operatic tenor Jan Peerce and talent agent Alice (Kalmanowitz) Peerce, Larry Peerce was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York. He attended the University of North Carolina. He made his directing debut with One Potato, Two Potato, released in 1964 by the distributor Cinema V. The groundbreaking drama about an interracial marriage between a white divorcee (played by Barbara Barrie, who won the Best Actress award at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival for the role) and an African-American office worker (Bernie Hamilton) was the first U.S. movie to portray such an interracial relationship.\n\nPeerce went on to direct several episodes of the Western television series Branded and the campy superhero series Batman, among other shows, before directing the early rock and roll concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, released in 1966 by American International Pictures and featuring such performers as The Byrds, Ray Charles, Bo Diddley, Donovan, The Lovin' Spoonful, The Ronettes and The Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\nFollowing more TV, Peerce returned to film in 1967 with The Mystery of the Chinese Junk and The Incident, the latter of which starred Martin Sheen and Tony Musante. He followed this with the acclaimed Goodbye, Columbus, an adaptation of the Philip Roth novel. The movie earned Peerce a DGA Award nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures, and screenwriter Arnold Schulman an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.\n\nPeerce's subsequent theatrical features included The Sporting Club, A Separate Peace, Ash Wednesday, and The Other Side of the Mountain. Peerce's work is frequently viewed as part of the expressive sentimental directorial style with a particular focus on coming-of-age stories.",

A pioneer of modern independent cinema, Soderbergh later drew acclaim for formally inventive films made within the studio system.\n\nSoderbergh's directorial breakthrough, the indie drama Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989), lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and the film garnered worldwide commercial success, as well as numerous accolades. His next five films, which included King of the Hill (1993), were commercially unsuccessful. He pivoted into more mainstream fare with the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), the biopic Erin Brockovich (2000) and the crime drama Traffic (2000). For Traffic, he won the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nHe found further popular and critical success with the Ocean's trilogy and film franchise (2001\u201318); Che (2008); The Informant! (2009); Contagion (2011); Haywire (2011); Magic Mike (2012); Side Effects (2013); Logan Lucky (2017); Unsane (2018); Let Them All Talk (2020); No Sudden Move (2021); and Kimi (2022). His film career spans a multitude of genres, but his specialties are psychological, crime and heist films. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, winning five.\n\nSoderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts which are regularly used for big-budget Hollywood movies, but he routinely employs an avant-garde arthouse approach. They center on themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films are often distinctive in the realm of cinematography as a result of his having been influenced by avant-garde cinema, coupled with his use of unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third-person vantage points.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steven Soderbergh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He also made a significant contribution to motion picture theater architecture from the 1930s to 1950s. He is credited as the designer of the Oscar statuette in 1928.\n\nGibbons was born in Dublin, Ireland and studied at the Art Students League of New York and worked for his architect father. While at Edison Studios from 1915, he first designed a set for a film released in 1919, assisting Hugo Ballin. But, after this first foray, the studio closed, and he signed with Samuel Goldwyn in 1918. This evolved to working for Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1924 to 1956\u2014a 32-year career.\n\nGibbons was one of the original 36 founding members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and oversaw the design of the Academy Awards statuette in 1928, a trophy for which he himself would be nominated 39 times, winning 11.\n\nHe retired in 1956 with about 1,500 films credited to him: however, his contract with MGM dictated that he receive credit as art director for every MGM film released in the United States, even though other designers may have done the bulk of the work. Even so, his actual hands-on art direction may have been on about 150 films.\n\nIn 1930, Gibbons married actress Dolores del R\u00edo and co-designed their house in Santa Monica, an intricate Art Deco residence influenced by Rudolf Schindler. They divorced in 1941; three years later he married actress Hazel Brooks with whom he remained until his death at the age of 67.\n\nGibbons's grave is in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.",

    "biography": "Richard Ewing \"Dick\" Powell (November 14, 1904 \u2013 January 2, 1963) was an American singer, actor, producer, director and studio boss.\n\nBorn in Mountain View, the seat of Stone County in northern Arkansas, Powell attended the former Little Rock College in the state capital, before he started his entertainment career as a singer with the Charlie Davis Orchestra, based in the midwest. He recorded a number of records with Davis and on his own, for the Vocalion label in the late 1920s.\n\nPowell moved to Pittsburgh, where he found great local success as the Master of Ceremonies at the Enright Theater and the Stanley Theater. In April 1930, Warner Bros. bought up Brunswick Records which at that time owned Vocalion. Warner Bros. was sufficiently impressed by Powell's singing and stage presence to offer him a film contract in 1932. He made his film debut as a singing bandleader in Blessed Event. He went on to star as a boyish crooner in movie musicals such as 42nd Street, Footlight Parade, Gold Diggers of 1933, Dames, Flirtation Walk, and On the Avenue, often appearing opposite Ruby Keeler and Joan Blondell.\n\nPowell desperately wanted to expand his range but Warner Bros. wouldn't allow him to do so, although they did (mis)cast him in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) as Lysander. This was to be Powell's only Shakespearean role and one he did not want to play, feeling that he was completely wrong for the part. Finally, reaching his forties and knowing that his young romantic leading man days were behind him he lobbied to play the lead in Double Indemnity. He lost out to Fred MacMurray, another Hollywood nice guy. MacMurray\u2019s success, however, fueled Powell\u2019s resolve to pursue projects with greater range and in 1944, he was cast in the first of a series of films noir, as private detective Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet, directed by Edward Dmytryk. The film was a big hit and Powell had successfully reinvented himself as a dramatic actor.\n\nThe following year Dmytryk and Powell re-teamed to make Cornered, a gripping, post-WWII thriller that helped define the film noir style. He became a popular \"tough guy\" lead appearing in movies such as Johnny O'Clock and Cry Danger. But 1948 saw him step out of the brutish type when he starred in Pitfall, a film noir that sees a bored insurance company worker fall for an innocent but dangerous femme fatale, played by Lizabeth Scott. Even when he appeared in lighter fare such as The Reformer and the Redhead and Susan Slept Here (1954) he never sang in his later roles. The latter, his final onscreen appearance in a feature film, did include a dance number with costar Debbie Reynolds.\n\nFrom 1949-1953, Powell played the lead role in the National Broadcasting Company radio theater production Richard Diamond, Private Detective. His character in the 30-minute weekly was a likable private detective with a quick wit. When Richard Diamond came to television in 1957, the lead role was portrayed by David Janssen.",

Andrew McLaglen was born in London, the son of British actor Victor McLaglen and Enid Lamont. He was from a film family that included eight uncles and an aunt, and he grew up on movie sets with his parents as well as John Wayne and John Ford. After working as an assistant director on a few smaller films, Ford gave him the assistant director job on the film The Quiet Man (1952). After a few more assistant or second director jobs, McLaglen directed his first film Gun The Man Down in 1956 - a western B-movie with James Arness, Angie Dickinson and Harry Carey, Jr.. He went on to work extensively in television directing, directing episodes of Perry Mason (7), Gunslinger (5), Rawhide (6), and then 99 episodes of Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel, The Lieutenant (4), The Virginian (2), and 96 episodes of Gunsmoke. Returning to films - directing Shenandoah (1965) and The Rare Breed (1966), both with James Stewart; The Devil's Brigade (1968), Mitchell (1975), The Wild Geese (1978), North Sea Hijack (1979), and The Sea Wolves (1980), mostly westerns, but later specializing in war or action films, his last being Return from the River Kwai (1989). He also worked many times with John Wayne in such films as McLintock! (1963), Hellfighters (1968), The Undefeated (1969), Chisum (1970), and Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973). He also directed The Last Hard Men (1976) which starred Charlton Heston and James Coburn. McLaglen directed films in an assortment of categories, including crime, war, historical and comedy, but he was most frequently a director of Westerns, and would be among the last of the American film directors to specialize in the Western genre.

The first three movies had been fairly straightforward chambara adventures, but with 1964's Sword of Seduction, Ikehiro steered the series into the surreal and stylistically outrageous extremes that made the Son of the Black Mass so legendary.",

    "biography": "Hayao Miyazaki (Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese manga artist and prominent film director and animator of many popular anime feature films. Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.\n\nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan\u2014until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic\u2014and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization. While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.",

    "biography": "Sir Ridley Scott (born November 30, 1937) is an English filmmaker. He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father \u2014 an officer in the Royal Engineers \u2014 was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.

    "biography": "Philippe de Broca (15 March 1933 \u2013 26 November 2004) was a French movie director.\n\nHe directed 30 full-length feature films, including the highly successful That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio), The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) and On Guard (Le Bossu). His works include historical, romantic epics such as Chouans! and King of Hearts (Le Roi de c\u0153ur), as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur), The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue), The African (L'Africain). He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort.\n\nPhilippe de Broca was born on 15 March 1933 in Paris, France. He was the son of a cinema set designer and the grandson of a well-known painter, Philippe de Broca. He studied at the Paris Photography and Cinematography School (\u00e9cole Vaugirard), graduating in 1953. He carried out his military service with the service cin\u00e9matographique des arm\u00e9es (army film service) in Germany and then in Algeria, directing or acting as head cameraman on short films. Greatly affected by the war he witnessed, he vowed to show life in its best light in his future films \u201cbecause laughter is the best defence against upsets in life\u201d. After his discharge from the military, he set off on a journey taking in the length of Africa in Berliet trucks before returning to Paris.\n\nHe began working as an intern with Henri Decoin, before finding assistant positions with Claude Chabrol: Bitter Reunion (Le Beau Serge), The Cousins (Les Cousins), Web of Passion (\u00c0 Double Tour), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: The 400 Blows (Les 400 Coups) and Pierre Schoendoerffer: Ramuntcho. In 1959, Claude Chabrol produced de Broca's first film for him, The Love Game (Les jeux de l\u2019amour) with Jean-Pierre Cassel. De Broca went on to work with Cassel again in The Joker (Le Farceur, 1960), Five Day Lover (L\u2019Amant de cinq jours, 1961), and Male Companion (Un Monsieur de Compagnie, 1964).\n\nDe Broca's first commercial success came with Swords of Blood (Cartouche), filmed in 1962. This film also saw two more names become associated with de Broca: the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine. International acclaim came with That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio) in 1964, Up to His Ears (Les tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine) in 1965, The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) in 1973 and Incorrigible (L'Incorrigible) in 1975.\n\nIn 1966, he co-wrote, directed and produced King of Hearts (Le Roi de C\u0153ur). This parody of the Great War, which some cinema-lovers consider his masterpiece, was a commercial and personal failure, to de Broca's dismay. Yet it eventually achieved genuine cult-film status during the mid 1970s when it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house, the Central Square Cinemas in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Philippe de Broca\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

    "biography": "John Frederick Milius is an American screenwriter, director, and producer of motion pictures. He was one of the writers for the first two Dirty Harry films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of Apocalypse Now, and wrote and directed The Wind and the Lion, Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn.\n\nHe wrote a number of iconic film lines such as \"Charlie don't surf\" and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" from Apocalypse Now, and the famous Dirty Harry one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including \"Go ahead, make my day\" and \"Ask yourself one question, 'do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?\". Milius also wrote the USS Indianapolis monologue in the film Jaws; the sequence performed by Robert Shaw.  After his work on Rough Riders (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in combat on San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: The Wind and the Lion (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film Rough Riders (where Tom Berenger took the role).\n\nThe character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti was inspired by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, made by his friends the Coen Brothers, was partly based on Milius. The novella \"Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls\" by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as \"sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick.\"\n\nIn 2013 a documentary about his life, titled Milius, was released.\n\nWriter Nat Segaloff called Milius:\n\n\"The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated\u2014some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends...  Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.\"\n\nMilius himself once said:\n\n\"Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don\u2019t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what\u2019s popular today [...] Write what you want to see. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to have any true passion in it, and it\u2019s not going to be done with any true artistry.\"",

Zombie followed the film with two sequels in his \"Firefly\" trilogy: The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 From Hell (2019). After the success of his first two films he directed Halloween (2007), a remake of the classic 1978 horror film. The film became his highest-grossing to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed Halloween II (2009), which failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor.

Though he had some American box office success with Necronomicon, his first women-in-prison film Ninety-Nine Women, and his two Christopher Lee films, The Bloody Judge and Count Dracula, he never achieved wide commercial success. Franco moved from Spain to France in 1970 so that he could make more violent and sexual films, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially, as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with a heavier accent on adult-oriented films. Although he produced a few well-received, low budget horror films in the early 70's, many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began churning out. Franco returned to low-budget horror in a brief comeback period from 1980-1983, but after 1983, his career took a second downturn. With the exception of Faceless and Killer Barbies, his films after 1984 are quite disliked and obscure due to their incredibly low budgets. Franco has nevertheless retained a large cult following through the years with his sexually-charged horror films, some of which are regarded as masterpieces by his avid followers.",

    "biography": "Brian Trenchard-Smith is an Anglo Australian film and television director, producer, and writer, with a reputation for large scale movies on small scale budgets, many of which display a quirky sense of humor that has earned him a cult following. Quentin Tarantino referred to him in Entertainment Weekly as one of his favorite directors. His early work is featured in Not Quite Hollywood, an award winning documentary released by Magnolia. Among his early successes were the 20th Century Fox release The Man from Hong Kong, a wry James Bond/Chop Sockey cocktail, the Vietnam battle movie Siege of Firebase Gloria, and the futuristic satire Dead End Drive-In, a particular Tarantino favorite. BMX Bandits, showcasing a 15-year old Nicole Kidman, and Miramax's The Quest, starring ET's Henry Thomas, won prizes at children's film festivals in Montreal and Europe. He has also directed 35 episodes of television series as diverse as Silk Stalkings, Time Trax, The Others, and Flipper. Born in England, where his Australian father was in the RAF, Trenchard-Smith attended UK's prestigious Wellington College, where he neglected studies in favor of acting and making short films, before migrating to Australia. He started as a news film editor, then graduated to network promos before he became one of a group of young people that, as he recalls, \"pushed, shoved, lobbied and bullied the government into introducing investment for Australian made films.\" He persuaded Australia's largest distribution-exhibition circuit at the time, the Greater Union Theater Organization, to form an in-house production company that he would run. The company made three successful films in a row, and his career was underway. In parallel careers, he was also founding editor of Australia's quarterly Movie magazine for 6 years, and has made over 100 trailers for other directors in Australia, Europe, and America. Among his 39 movies, 5 were commissioned by Showtime, including the remake of the World War II classic, Sahara, the highly rated, Happy Face Murders, starring Ann-Margret, and DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, with Timothy Bottoms as President Bush. His frequently repeated family drama for Lifetime, Long Lost Son starring Gabrielle Anwar, introduced future Gossip Girl's Chace Crawford to audiences in the title role.\" I knew from his first scene, he was going to be hot.\" In 2009, Trenchard-Smith shot Porky's - The College Years, a re-imagining of the famous 80's franchise of teen comedies. His recent ecological thriller Arctic Blast, starring Michael Shanks, was chosen to premiere at the 2010 Possible Worlds Canadian Film Festival in Sydney. Trenchard-Smith writes for filmindustrybloggers.com as The Genre Director, and is a contributing guru to trailersfromhell.com. He is married to Byzantine historian Dr. Margaret Trenchard-Smith, lives in Los Angeles, and is a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.",

In 1938, he transferred to the Schauspielschule des Staatlichen Schauspielhauses (drama school) in Berlin. In 1939, because of his membership in the B\u00fcndischen Jugend he was imprisoned for many months in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After his release he moved to Vienna, and then in 1944 to Switzerland.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, he starred in many films, like Die letzte Br\u00fccke (1953) and Es geschah am 20. Juli (1955). He was also a photographer. His first attempt at directing came three years later with the documentary Warum sind sie gegen uns? (1958).

In the 1970s, he directed Vampire Circus (1972) and Hammer House of Horror. He directed several episodes of Minder and Bergerac in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial The Mad Death which centred around a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on Robin of Sherwood, for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes.\n\nYoung moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing Jeeves and Wooster based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and GBH, for which he was nominated for a BATA award. It was partly on the strength of GBH that he was assigned to direct Fierce Creatures, John Cleese's 1997 follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda, which featured many of the same cast as GBH. However, the production ran into problems and Fred Schepisi was brought in to finalise the movie. Young did, however, direct Splitting Heirs, which starred Cleese and Eric Idle.\n\nYoung has continued to work on television drama since then.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Young (director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008\u20132014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "place_of_birth": "Carthage, New York, USA",
    "biography": "An American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor, composer, and occasional actor.\n\nAlthough Carpenter has worked in numerous film genres in his four-decade career, his name is most commonly associated with horror and science fiction.\n\nMost films in Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984).\n\nHowever, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be viewed as cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. Cult classics that Carpenter directed include: Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995).\n\nHis films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of steadicam, and distinctive synthesized scores. Carpenter is also notable for having composed or co-composed most of the music of his films; some of them are now considered cult as well, with the main theme of Halloween being considered a part of popular culture. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics. He released his first studio album Lost Themes in 2015, and also won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Vampires (1998).\n\nCarpenter is an outspoken proponent of widescreen filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were filmed anamorphic with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was shot in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\", preferring it over both digital and 3D film. Many of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features.\n\nCarpenter has been the subject of the documentary film John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies, and American Cinematheque's 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed Halloween to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his The Director's Chair series on El Rey Network.\n\nMany filmmakers have been influenced by Carpenter, including James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino (The Hateful Eight was heavily influenced by The Thing), Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bong Joon-ho, among others.\n\nThe video game Dead Space 3 is said to be influenced by Carpenter's The Thing, The Fog and Halloween, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film.",

By 1991, he had starred in three successful films, and would go on to achieve greater fame in Under Siege (1992), where he played Navy SEALs counter-terrorist expert Casey Ryback.\n\nHowever, his image became tarnished when both On Deadly Ground (1994, which he directed) and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995) did poorly in theaters. During the later half of the 90s, he starred in three more theatrical films and a direct-to-video The Patriot. Aside from Exit Wounds (2001) and Half Past Dead (2002), his career shifted almost entirely to direct-to-video films (often low budget productions and shot in Europe or Asia). Between 1998 to 2009, he appeared in a total of 22 of these. At the age of 59, he finally returned to the big screen as Torrez in the 2010 film Machete.\n\nSeagal is also a recording artist and guitarist and the founder of Steven Seagal Enterprises. In addition to his professional achievements, he is also known as an environmentalist, an animal rights activist and a supporter of the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, and the Tibetan independence movement.",

Mario Philip Azzopardi should not be confused with Maltese poet, short story writer and columnist Mario Azzopardi (born 1944), who is also involved in theatre and directs the Malta Drama Centre. In 1971, while still a student at the Royal University of Malta, he directed Ga\u0121\u0121a, presumed to be the first full-length feature filmed entirely in Maltese. Transferred to digital format and enhanced, the film was re-released in Malta in March 2007. Azzopardi left his native Malta for Canada in 1978, following a dispute with local censors and theatre authorities who, in 1977, had cancelled his play, Sulari Fuq Strada Stretta, on the grounds that it was too offensive; the play was eventually presented at the Manoel Theatre in January 2008. Azzopardi was educated at St Aloysius' College (Birkirkara, Malta), and the Royal University of Malta.

    "biography": "Colin T. Trevorrow (US: /tr\u0259\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0ro\u028a/; born September 13, 1976) is an American film director and screenwriter. He directed the indie film Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) and the blockbuster film Jurassic World (2015), and also co-wrote the script to Jurassic World and its 2018 sequel.\n\nTrevorrow was born on September 13, 1976 in San Francisco, California. He was raised in Oakland, California. His father was a musician in a country rock band and his mother was a photographer who also operated a day-care center. He is Jewish on his mother's side.\n\nAs a boy, he sang in the chorus of the San Francisco Opera. As a teenager, Trevorrow won awards from the Mill Valley Film Festival and the San Francisco Youth Film Festival. Trevorrow graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California, and later graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.\n\nIn 2002, he wrote and directed his first short film, Home Base; as of 2012, it had received over 20 million hits online. Trevorrow's first theatrical release was with Reality Show, a 2004 documentary film about the failed production of a reality television show. Trevorrow sold his first spec script titled Tester to DreamWorks in 2006. In 2008, he paired up with Derek Connolly, ten years after they had first met as NYU students while working as interns on Saturday Night Live, to write a buddy cop film script called Cocked and Loaded. Trevorrow said that the experience was so enjoyable that he decided to give up solo screenwriting and work with Connolly.\n\nIn 2012, Trevorrow directed Safety Not Guaranteed, a film inspired by a classified advertisement which ran in a 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine that read: \"Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 322, Oakview, CA 93022. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.\" The script was by Connolly, who intended for Trevorrow to direct it. The film received various accolades, including a nomination for Trevorrow for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, where it picked up the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. After the release of Safety Not Guaranteed, Trevorrow and Connolly were hired by the Walt Disney Company to write an as-yet unmade remake of the film Flight of the Navigator (1986). Trevorrow co-wrote and directed Jurassic World (2015), and also provided his voice for the film's character of Mr. DNA. Connolly and Trevorrow also co-wrote the screenplay for its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which was released in June 2018 and for which Trevorrow is an executive producer.\n\nAfter Jurassic World, Trevorrow next directed The Book of Henry, which was written by Gregg Hurwitz. The film was released by Focus Features on June 16, 2017 to generally negative reviews, although Trevorrow stood by the film.\n\nOn March 30, 2018 it was announced that Trevorrow would be returning to the Jurassic Park franchise to direct Jurassic World 3 (2021).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Colin Trevorow, licensed under CC-BY-SA, ful list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "place_of_birth": "Rome, Lazio, Italy",
    "biography": "Bruno Mattei (30 July 1931 \u2013 21 May 2007) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and editor who directed exploitation films in many genres, including women in prison, nunsploitation, zombie, mondo, cannibal, and Nazisploitation films. Born in 1931, Bruno Mattei grew up in Rome, Italy, where his father owned a small film editing studio. Mattei made his debut as a director with the drama Armida, il dramma di una sposa(1970) under the alias \"Jordon B. Matthews\". He eventually had more pseudonyms than any working director in the world. He returned to editing before making another comeback in 1976 with two low-budget Nazi exploitation films, Women's Camp 119 (1977) (aka \"Women's Camp 119\") and Casa privata per le SS (1977) (aka \"SS Girls\"). Mattei followed these taboo-breaking films with excursions into porno films and mondo \"shockumentaries\", all directed under his many pseudonyms, concentrating on \"shock value\" with films such as Mondo erotico (1973), \"Libiodomania\" and \"Libidomania 2\". Always on the lookout for new exploitation avenues, Mattei followed with \"nunsploitation\", with the softcore sex film La vera storia della monaca di Monza (1980) and the violent sex thriller The Other Hell (1981). Both films involved a partnership with writer/director Claudio Fragasso, who helped him write and direct the back-to-back productions. Using yet another alias, \"Vincent Dawn\", Mattei directed Hell of the Living Dead (1980) (aka \"Hell of the Living Dead\"), a low-budged zombie picture inspired by other zombie cannibal movies such as Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 (1979). \"Virus\" was filmed in Spain and used jungle footage from New Guinea and a patch soundtrack from Goblins \"Dawn of the Dead\" soundtrack, which was a minor hit in Italy and abroad. After directing two women's prison films starring Laura Gemser, Mattei moved to directing sword-and-sorcery flicks, starting with I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983). Both Mattei and Fragasso collaborated on the sci-fi/horror flick Rats - Notte di terrore (1984), inspired by the futuristic movies of the early 1980s. Mattei considers this his best work, despite his still having to work with a very low budget. He worked relentlessly through the 1980s, directing a pair of \"spaghetti westerns\", some action flicks and about half of Zombi 3 (1988) after Lucio Fulci was taken off the production, though Mattei was not credited with it. In the early 1990s Mattei directed a series of erotic thrillers and a made-for-TV movie, Cruel Jaws (1995) (TV), which was inspired by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975). Mattei continued making films, with more than 50 to his credit by the 200s. In early 2007 his health becan to decline rapidly after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Despite his doctor's warnings, he went through with a surgical operation to have the tumor removed in May of that year. After the surgery he fell into a coma from complications, and died a few days later on May 21, 2007 at age 75.",

    "biography": "Writer, director and producer Matt Cimber was born as Matteo Ottaviano in 1936 and began his career in the early 60s directing off-Broadway plays including works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tennessee Williams and the US premieres of the Jean Cocteau trilogy. During his theater years, Cimber rewrote Burning Bright with John Steinbeck which introduced Sandy Dennis who went on to win an Academy Award for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) . Cimber then directed the Broadway revival of Bus Stop, where he met future wife Jayne Mansfield. Matt made his cinematic directorial debut with the offbeat Single Room Furnished (1966), which was also Mansfield's last movie. He followed this movie with the film The Sexually Liberated Female (1970) which was based on a best-selling book The Sensuous Female by J. As the screenwriter / director of this film, Cimber made a satire which required the title be changed for release because the publisher rescinded the rights. Cimber did three immensely enjoyable blaxploitation pictures in the mid 70s: The Black 6 (1973), Lady Cocoa (1975) and the terrifically trashy The Candy Tangerine Man (1975) which was also Samuel L. Jackson 's favorite film. Matt made a rare foray into the horror genre with the disturbing psychological shocker The Witch Who Came from the Sea (1976). His next work was based on a Mario Puzo story, a World War II drama A Time to Die (1982) starring Rex Harrison. Later that year Matt teamed up with Pia Zadora for two films: the underrated Butterfly (1981) and the fun Fake-Out (1982). Butterfly (1981) was the master filmmaker Orson Welles last film for which he received one of the film's three Golden Globe nominations. The following year Matt joined forces with actress Laurene Landon for the delightful action/adventure romps Hundra (1983) and Yellow Hair and the Pecos Kid (1984). Quentin Tarantino is quoted as saying Matt Cimber films were among his favorite. In the late 80s, Cimber created and directed the successful TV series GLOW: Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (1986) . The show was lasted for four seasons on 103 stations in the US. More recent years of Cimber's work were dedicated to a documentary genre. He wrote and directed \"An American Icon: Coca-Cola, the Early Years\" (1997) and \"The History of United Nations\" (1996). He created and wrote the eight-minute intro for visitors to the United Nations for which he received a special commendation from the UN. After a twenty years absence in motion picture production, Matt Cimber made a comeback with the independent drama Miriam (2006).",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nKenneth Johnson (born 26 October 1942) is an American screenwriter, producer and director best known as the creator of the V science fiction franchise and The Incredible Hulk TV series. His creative efforts are almost entirely concentrated in the area of television science fiction.\n\nA native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Johnson is a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. His early TV work includes The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and The Incredible Hulk. Johnson created the character of Jaime Sommers and the Bionic Woman series.\n\nIn 1983, he wrote and directed the original miniseries V, about an invasion of Earth by reptilian aliens. The miniseries aired on NBC, and a year later was followed by a sequel, V: The Final Battle, which Johnson briefly worked on before leaving the project due to disagreements with the network. Johnson was subsequently credited as a co-writer of the sequel miniseries under the pseudonym Lillian Weezer, and was not involved at all in the weekly V television series that followed.\n\nIn 1989, he produced the television series Alien Nation based on the 1988 film of the same name.\n\nIn 1997, he wrote and directed the movie Steel, based on the DC comic book character Steel. It featured basketball player Shaquille O'Neal as John Henry Irons, the character's alter-ego.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson announced his completion of a four hour script for a new V mini series called V: The Second Generation. The storyline takes place 20 years after the original 1983 mini-series, ignoring the second mini-series (V: The Final Battle) and subsequent weekly television series. However, NBC told Johnson that they were more interested in a remake of the original V mini-series instead, which, if successful, might lead to his proposed sequel.\n\nSince then, Johnson adapted his screenplay for V: The Second Generation into a novel. It was published by Tor Books and released on February 5, 2008. However, since his discussions with NBC, Warner Bros (who hold the television rights to the V franchise) have opted to produce a remake of V (written by Scott Peters) for the ABC Network, thus ending any prospect of Johnson's sequel being produced for television.\n\nIn April 2008, Johnson stated his intention to remake the original V mini-series and his new sequel V: The Second Generation into feature films. Johnson claimed to have been in discussions with producers interested in the project, though was extremely vague:\n\n\"... since I own the motion picture rights to V, we\u2019re in the process to do a remake of the original mini-series first as a theatrical feature, which I\u2019m so jazzed about because it will give me an opportunity to really realize it and execute it in a way that was impossible to do back then. Then that will lead to the obvious sequel, because it is a franchise, and then we\u2019ll get into The Second Generation and I'm hoping we\u2019ll be able to do two movies, because there\u2019s certainly enough material in the novel to warrant two separate sequels. That\u2019s my goal at this point and that\u2019s what we\u2019re in the process of doing. I just literally came from a meeting, 15\u201320 minutes ago with a fellow in Beverly Hills who really says that we\u2019re gonna do it.\"\n\nHowever, since this statement, Johnson's potential film production has not been developed further, whilst Warner Bros' television remake for ABC premiered on November 3, 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Johnson (producer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He financed his own films through his production companies Boll KG and Event Film Productions. Many of his films were produced on low budgets and Boll himself had backed his projects financially or made use of crowdfunding platforms.\n\nBoll's filmmaking career is generally divided into two distinct phases: the first consists of big budget films with a usually renowned cast, most of which gained him a reputation as a \"schlock maestro\", while receiving highly negative reviews from critics, with Alone in the Dark being considered one of the worst films ever made. His second phase is marked by films with a smaller budget or were independently made, relatively unknown actors and different approaches to filmmaking; Boll's Rampage film series, Tunnel Rats, Stoic, Amoklauf, Heart of America, Assault on Wall Street and Darfur were better received by critics.\n\nBoll decided to branch out from filmmaking in 2016 to work in the restaurant industry. He opened his Bauhaus Restaurant in Vancouver, which has earned positive reviews among food critics.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Uwe Boll, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Karlson directed 99 River Street, Kansas City Confidential and Hell's Island all with actor John Payne in the early 1950s. Other films include Rocky (1948), The Phenix City Story (1955), 5 Against the House (1955) and The Young Doctors (1961).\n\nPhil Karlson was the son of popular Irish actress Lillian O'Brien.\n\nHe studied painting at Chicago's Art Institute, and law, at his father's request, at Loyola Marymount University in California.\n\nKarlson got into the film industry working as a prop man while a law student. After working a number of film jobs, including being an assistant director for a number of Abbott and Costello films, Karlson directed his first film in 1944 and in 1948 directed the first film starring Marilyn Monroe, Ladies of the Chorus. He worked on a number of low-budget projects for Monogram Pictures and Eagle-Lion Films before making his mark in 1950. It was then that he was known for directing tough, realistic and sometimes violent gritty crime films. In the 1960s the quality of his directed films declined, which included working on Kid Galahad (1962) with Elvis Presley and two Dean Martin Matt Helm spy films, including The Wrecking Crew (1969) co-starring Sharon Tate and Elke Sommer. He had his biggest success in 1973 when he directed the hit film, Walking Tall. The film made the director a rich man many times over, thanks to the fact that he owned a huge part of the movie.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Phil Karlson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence, and has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson and David Lynch. After a failed attempt to return to filmmaking with a film entitled King Shot starring Marilyn Manson and produced by David Lynch, Alejandro is set to return to cinema with the sequel to El Topo entitled Abel Cain sometime in late 2011 or 2012.\n\nJodorowsky is also a playwright and play director, having produced over one hundred plays, primarily in Mexico where he lived for much of his life. Alongside this he is also a writer, particularly of comic books - his The Incal even has been noted as having a claim to be \"the best comic book\" ever written - as well as books on his own theories about spirituality. Jodorowsky has been involved in the occult and various spiritual and religious groups, including Zen Buddhism and forms of Mexican shamanism, and has formulated his own spiritual system, which he has called \"psychomagic\" and \"psychoshamanism\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alejandro Jodorowsky, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  \n\nAntonio Margheriti (19 September 1930 \u2013 4 November 2002), also known under the pseudonym Anthony M. Dawson, was a prolific Italian filmmaker. He was born in Rome and died in 2002 from a heart attack in Monterosi, Viterbo, near Rome at the age of 72.\n\nMargheriti started out in the Italian film industry in 1956 as a screenwriter. He started directing in 1960, his first film being \"Spacemen\" (aka \"Assignment Outer Space\"). Margheriti is known for his science fiction, horror, spaghetti western and action movies. He was the director of such cult movies as Cannibal Apocalypse, Castle of Blood, The Virgin of Nuremberg, Assignment Outer Space, Wild Wild Planet, Naked You Die, Mr. Super Invisible, The Last Hunter, Battle of the Worlds and numerous others. Most of his films were directed under the pseudonym of Anthony M. Dawson. He stopped using his real name in the USA early in his career, when he realized the English translation of the name \"Antonio Margheriti\" was \"Anthony Daisies\", and he thought it sounded too effeminate.\n\nHe was the only Italian director who worked directly for American production companies like MGM, United Artists, 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, etc. with films like: Yor, the Hunter from the Future, Take a Hard Ride, Killer Fish, etc. Margheriti said his action/adventure films were his favorites, and his least favorite movies were the sword-and-sandal peplum films he made in the early 1960s (such as \"Devil of the Desert\" and \"Giants of Rome\").\n\nFor years, director Richard Morrissey disputed Margheriti's claim that he had directed \"Andy Warhol's Frankenstein\" in the early 1970s, saying that Margheriti was mostly just a technical advisor on that film. Morrissey said Margheriti did however direct a very, very brief segment of the movie (mostly the scenes involving the two children roaming around in the lab).\n\nMargheriti worked with many well-known genre actors such as Lee Van Cleef, John Saxon, Claude Rains, John Morghen, Klaus Kinski, Barbara Steele, Reb Brown, Donald Pleasence, Yul Brynner, David Warbeck, Luciano Pigozzi, Marvin Hagler, Terence Hill, Fred Williamson, Christopher Lee and many others. Most of his later films were shot in the Philippines (especially his war films). Margheriti also collaborated on the special effects in two Italian cult films which he did not direct, Sergio Leone's \"Fistful of Dynamite\" (1971) and Aldo Lado's \"The Humanoid\" (1979).\n\nMargheriti retired from filmmaking in 1996 at age 66. He died in 2002 of natural causes. Margheriti's son Edoardo and his daughter Antonella are both also involved in filmmaking. Eli Roth's character in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Bastards took Margheriti as his namesake.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Antonio Margheriti,  licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Ultimately raised in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee was a child actor appearing in more than 20 films. At the age of 13, Bruce took up the study of wing chun gung fu under renowned wing chun master, Yip Man. Bruce left Hong Kong at the age of 18, came to the United States and made his way to Seattle, Washington where he worked in the restaurant of a family friend. He soon enrolled in the University of Washington where he pursued a degree in philosophy. Bruce began to teach gung fu in Seattle and soon opened his first school, the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. Two more schools followed in Oakland and Los Angeles. Concurrently Bruce married his wife, Linda and had his two children, Brandon and Shannon. In the mid sixties, Bruce was discovered while doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals and a role as Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet soon followed. During this time, Bruce was also developing his own martial art, which he ultimately named Jeet Kune Do (translated: the way of the intercepting fist). Bruce's art was steeped in a philosophical foundation and did not follow long held martial traditions. Instead it had at its core the ideas of simplicity, directness and personal freedom. After The Green Hornet series was canceled, Bruce encountered resistance while working in Hollywood and so headed to Hong Kong to pursue a film career. In Hong Kong he made 3 films, which consecutively broke all box office records and showcased martial arts in an entirely new way. Hollywood took notice and soon Bruce was making the first Hollywood / Hong Kong coproduction with a film called Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately, Bruce Lee died in 1973 before this film was released. This film catapulted him to international fame. Today Bruce Lee\u2019s legacy of self expression, equality, and pioneering innovation continues to inspire people all around the world.",

He started at the Selig Polyscope Company and eventually moved to Keystone Studios, where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd as well as with his nephew, Al St. John. He also mentored Charlie Chaplin, Monty Banks and Bob Hope, and brought vaudeville star Buster Keaton into the movie business. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s and one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood at the time.\n\nIn one of the earliest Hollywood scandals, Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials between November 1921 and April 1922 for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. Rappe had fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel in September 1921, and died four days later. A friend of Rappe accused Arbuckle of raping and accidentally killing her. The first two trials resulted in hung juries, but the third acquitted Arbuckle. The third jury took the unusual step of giving Arbuckle a written statement of apology for his treatment by the justice system. Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal largely halted his career and has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian.",

The two started collaborating in 2000 and Kravchuk, who had earlier made a short documentary about orphanages, decided to adapt the story into a film, Italianetz (The Italian).",

McGowan, as he was usually known, remains the only Australian to have been made a life member of the Screen Directors Guild (now Directors Guild of America).\n\nBorn in the then-bustling railway centre of Terowie in South Australia, McGowan grew up in Adelaide (Islington) and Sydney. He was a capable horseman and served in the Second Boer War with Montmorency's Scouts as a special dispatch rider.\n\nMcGowan directed and often acted in the first 33 episodes of Kalem's 1914 adventure film series, The Hazards of Helen, which eventually ran to 54 episodes, some still with McGowan's participation. While filming he began a relationship with Helen Holmes, the film's star, and the two married. They left Kalem to set up their own production company, Signal Films, which successfully made a series of railroad melodramas but lost out when their distributor (Mutual) failed. The collaboration ended when they divorced in 1925. There was an adopted daughter, Kaye.\n\nMcGowan successfully made the transition from silent film to talkies. While never a major star, in a busy career that spanned four decades he is credited with acting in 232 films\u2014mostly strong roles like sheriff or villain\u2014writing 26 screenplays and directing 242 productions. In 1932 he directed a young John Wayne in the 12-episode rail vs airplane serial The Hurricane Express for the independent Mascot Pictures. From 1938 to 1951, as Executive Secretary of the Screen Directors Guild, he fought to secure recognition for the director within the studio systems of the film and emerging television industry.\n\nJ.P. McGowan died in 1952 in Hollywood and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGeorge Seaton (April 17, 1911 \u2013 July 28, 1979) was an American screenwriter, playwright, film director and producer, and theatre director.\n\nBorn George Stenius in South Bend, Indiana, Seaton moved to Detroit after graduating from college to work as an actor on radio station WXYZ. John L. Barrett played The Lone Ranger on test broadcasts of the series in early January 1933, but when the program became part of the regular schedule Seaton was cast in the title role. In later years he claimed to have devised the cry \"Hi-yo, Silver\" because he couldn't whistle for his horse as the script required.\n\nSeaton joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a contract writer in 1933. His first major screen credit was the Marx Brothers comedy A Day at the Races in 1937. In the early 1940s he joined 20th Century Fox, where he remained for the rest of the decade, writing scripts for Moon Over Miami, Coney Island, Charley's Aunt, The Song of Bernadette, and others before making his directorial debut with Diamond Horseshoe in 1945. From this point on he was credited as both screenwriter and director for most of his films, including The Shocking Miss Pilgrim, Miracle on 34th Street, Apartment for Peggy, Chicken Every Sunday, The Big Lift, For Heaven's Sake, Little Boy Lost, The Country Girl, and The Proud and Profane.\n\nBut Not Goodbye, Seaton's 1944 Broadway debut as a playwright, closed after only 23 performances, although it later was adapted for the 1946 film The Cockeyed Miracle by Karen DeWolf. In 1967 he returned to Broadway to direct the Norman Krasna play Love in E Flat, which was a critical and commercial flop. The musical Here's Love, adapted from his screenplay for Miracle on 34th Street by Meredith Willson, proved to be more successful.\n\nSeaton won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay twice, for Miracle on 34th Street (which also earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay) and The Country Girl, and was nominated for Oscars three additional times. He received The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1961.\n\nSeaton died of cancer in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Seaton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRobert Earl Wise (September 10, 1914 \u2013 September 14, 2005) was an American sound effects editor, film editor, film producer and director. He won Academy Awards as Best Director for The Sound of Music (1965) and West Side Story (1961) as well as nominations as Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941) and Best Picture for The Sand Pebbles (1966).\n\nAmong his other films are Born to Kill; Destination Gobi; The Hindenburg; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; The Day the Earth Stood Still; Run Silent, Run Deep; The Andromeda Strain; The Set-Up; The Haunting; and The Body Snatcher. Wise's working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.\n\nOften contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story to dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise's notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise's approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from horror to noir to Western to war films to science fiction, to musical and drama, with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise's tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many Academy Award-winning films the result. Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.\n\n \n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Wise, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

These films featured a rotating \"stock company\" of actors mostly made up of Playboy Playmates and Penthouse \"Pets\", including Julie Strain, Dona Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Cynthia Brimhall, Roberta Vasquez, Julie K. Smith, Shae Marks, and Wendy Hamilton. Several of his films were done wholly or largely in Shreveport using many local actors or actors with local ties.\n\nBefore the B-movies, Sidaris was a pioneer in sports television. He directed coverage of hundreds of football and basketball games, Olympic events, and special programs and won seven Emmy awards for his work in the field. His best known work was with ABC's Wide World of Sports; he was the show's first director, and continued in that post for 25 years.\n\nSidaris pioneered what he called the \"honey shot\", close-ups of cheerleaders and pretty girls in the stands at sporting events. He won an Emmy Award in 1969 for directing the Summer Olympics. He expanded into dramatic television in the 1970s, directing episodes of programs like Gemini Man (1976), CBS's Kojak (mid-1970s), ABC's The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries (late-1970s) and ABC's Monday Night Football.\n\nHe expanded into film, specializing in action flicks featuring buxom gun-toting Playboy Playmates and Penthouse Pets with titles like Fit to Kill and Savage Beach. Most of Sidaris' \"Triple B\" series (later given the title L.E.T.H.A.L. Ladies) focused on the adventures of a team of secret agents and were mostly filmed in Hawaii. Several entries in the series were merely produced by him and were written and directed by others. Although the series featured recurring characters, continuity between films was not a priority and it was common for an actress who played a villain (and was killed off) in one film to re-appear in a subsequent film as a hero.\n\nWith his wife, Arlene T. Sidaris (born ca. 1942) as his production partner, Sidaris made twelve films. After Sidaris' death, she runs the official websites of his twelve films.",

    "biography": "Ralph Bakshi (born October 29, 1938) is an American director of animated and live-action films. In the 1970s, he established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions. Between 1972 and 1992, he directed nine theatrically released feature films, five of which he wrote. He has been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator.\n\nBeginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to director. He moved to the animation division of Paramount Pictures in 1967 and started his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in 1968. Through producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi made his debut feature film, Fritz the Cat, released in 1972. It was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, and the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nOver the next eleven years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. He is well known for his fantasy films, which include Wizards (1977), The Lord of the Rings (1978) and Fire and Ice (1983). In 1987, Bakshi returned to television work, producing the series Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, which ran for two years before it was canceled due to complaints from a conservative political group over perceived drug references. After a nine-year hiatus from feature films, he directed Cool World (1992), which was largely rewritten during production and received poor reviews. Bakshi returned to television with the live-action film Cool and the Crazy (1994) and the anthology series Spicy City (1997).\n\nHe founded the Bakshi School of Animation and Cartooning in 2003. During the 2000s, he has focused largely on painting. He has received several awards for his work, including the 1980 Golden Gryphon for The Lord of the Rings at the Giffoni Film Festival, the 1988 Annie Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation, and the 2003 Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ralph Bakshi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He won Emmy Awards for his direction on East Side/West Side in 1964 and The Glass House in 1972.\n\nIn the cinema, Gries directed some low-budget movies in the 1950s before concentrating his efforts more on TV. In the late 1960s, he wrote and directed what is generally acknowledged to be his greatest work in either medium, the western Will Penny, which starred Charlton Heston and was released in 1968. It was based on an episode of the TV series The Westerner that Gries wrote and directed in 1960, entitled \"Line Camp\". Gries subsequently made two other films with Heston, the much less successful Number One, and The Hawaiians, and directed several other films with other high profile actors such as Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson into the 1970s, though they failed to reach the critical approval that Will Penny received. The most successful of his later works was Helter Skelter, made in 1976, which was a TV film based on the notorious Charles Manson Family.\n\nDuring post-production on his final film, The Greatest (1977), a biography on boxer Muhammed Ali (in which Ali also played himself), Tom Gries collapsed and died of a heart attack while playing tennis. He was 54 years old.\n\nHe is the father of actor/director Jon Gries (who appeared under the name Jon Francis in Will Penny as a child actor).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tom Gries, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Sylvester Stallone (born Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush.\n\nHe subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976\u2013present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, he was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. His film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, his films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood\u2019s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film\u2019s production. He would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982\u20132019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, he would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nHe declined in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, he launched The Expendables films series (2010\u20132014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought him praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.",

    "biography": "Michel Haznavicius (born 29 March 1967) is a French film director, producer and screenwriter best known for his spy movie parodies OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and OSS 117: Lost in Rio, both of which star Jean Dujardin. His 2011 film The Artist competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival but lost to The Tree of Life. Dujardin though won the best actor prize at Cannes for his role in The Artist.\n\nHazanavicius was born in Paris. His family is Jewish, and originally from Lithuania. His grandparents were from both Poland and Lithuania and settled in France in the 1920s. Before directing films, Hazanavicius worked in television, beginning with the Canal+ channel, where he started as a director in 1988. He began directing commercials for companies such as Reebok and Bouygues Telecom, and then, in 1993, he made his first feature-length film, La Classe am\u00e9ricaine, for television. The film, co-directed with Dominique M\u00e9zerette, consisted entirely of footage taken from various films produced by the Warner Bros. studio, re-edited and dubbed into French. In 1997, Hazanavicius directed his first short film, Echec au capital, and followed it up with his first theatrically released feature, Mes amis, which starred his brother, actor Serge Hazanavicius.\n\nSeven years later, Hazanavicius wrote and directed his second feature, OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a parody of 1960s spy movies and specifically of OSS 117, a popular character created by Jean Bruce in 1949. The $17.5 million film was a modest box office success, with $23 million worldwide receipts. A sequel, OSS 117: Lost in Rio, followed in 2009. Both films were later distributed in the United States by Music Box Films. The Artist, a black and white film without dialogue which takes place in Hollywood on the eve of sound film, screened in competition at the 2011 Cannes International Film Festival. The Artist was later released to universal acclaim. On 24 January 2012 Hazanavicius received nominations for three Oscars: the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Hazanavicius said winning an Oscar would be \"like dreaming of going to the moon \u2013 you don't really believe it could ever happen.\" Hazanavicius won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Artist, at the 84th Academy Awards. He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2012 along with 175 other individuals.\n\nHe contributed a section to the omnibus film The Players (Les Infid\u00e8les) starring Jean Dujardin. He then announced that his next feature film would be a remake of the 1948 Fred Zinnemann film The Search. The film stars Berenice Bejo in the Montgomery Clift role as an NGO worker helping a little boy find his family in modern-day Chechnya and was produced by Thomas Langmann. Golden Globe Award actress winner Annette Bening also stars in the film.\n\nHazanavicius was in a relationship with film director Virginia Lovisone, and they have two daughters together, Simone and Fantine. He is married to B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, who acted in his films OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, The Artist and The Search. Hazanavicius and Bejo have two children together: Lucien and Gloria.",

His paternal grandparents were Polish. In 1967, the family moved to California, and young Gregor grew up near San Diego. His biggest influences as a kid were Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis and Black Sabbath's Master of Reality. He started his professional career as a guitarist for punk-rock bands, such as The Daredevils and The Little Kings, and also made his first films together with friends. After having developed a passion for filmmaking, he sold his guitar to buy a Super-8mm camera. Then Verbinski attended the prestigious UCLA Film School, from which he graduated in 1987 with his BFA in Film. His first professional directing jobs were music videos for alternative bands, such as L7, Bad Religion, and Monster Magnet. Then he moved to advertising and directed commercials for Nike, Canon, Skittles, United airlines and Coca-Cola. In 1993 he created the renowned Budweiser advertising campaign featuring croaking frogs, for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards.\n\nVerbinski made his feature directorial debut with Mousehunt (1997), a remarkably visual cartoonish family comedy. His next effort, The Mexican (2001), came to a modest result. However, Verbinski bounced back with a hit thriller The Ring (2002), grossing over $230 million dollars worldwide. His biggest directorial success came with the Disney theme park ride based Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), with a brilliant acting ensemble, grossing over $650 million dollars, and bringing five Oscar nominations and many other awards and nominations. Disney ordered two more films which Verbinski shot one after another on location in the Carribean islands, for which he had to endure both tetanus and typhoid immunization shots. After having survived several hurricanes, dealing with sick and injured actors, and troubleshooting after numerous technical difficulties of the epic-scale project, Verbinski delivered. He employed the same stellar cast in the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and the third installment of the 'Pirates' franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).\n\nGore Verbinski does not like publicity. He has been enjoying a happy family life with his wife and his two sons. He resides with his family in Los Angeles, California.",

He died in \u00c4ngelholm, Sk\u00e5ne l\u00e4n, Sweden of stomach cancer.\n\nWiderberg was the director of films such as Raven's End (1963), Elvira Madigan (1967), \u00c5dalen 31 (1969), Joe Hill (1971), Fimpen (1974), The Man on the Roof (1976), Victoria (1979), The Man from Majorca (1984), The Serpent's Way (1986) and All Things Fair (1995).\n\nHe won a Silver Bear prize in Berlin for All things fair and a Special Grand Jury Prize at Cannes Festival for \u00c5dalen 31. Raven's End, \u00c5dalen 31 and All things fair all received a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar Nomination\n\nBo Widerberg's vision of Swedish cinema parted radically with its contemporary form. He called for a greater political significance and more progressive story telling. Bergman being the leading figure of Swedish cinema, was not his ideal at all, although he recognized his position: \"Nor me or my friends saw very much in him. We didn't find the issue of god's existence that damn important. But it's safe to say you'd be putting yourself in a bad position if you're trying to slit the throat of the father figure before your own debut.\" In his book A vision of Swedish cinema he concluded that Ingmar Bergman's films almost exclusively dealt with issues directed upwards, but more seldom in sideways, between people. According to Widerberg, Bergman made vertical films when the need for horizontal ones was most dire. On the other hand, Widerberg wanted film to be a tool of the social sciences, a kind of sociological report.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bo Widerberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\n",

He tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work and later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman / Ring Lardner play June Moon in 1929. He has also acted in London, England.\n\nHe started working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts. His film acting credits include Prosperity (1932), Pilgrimage (1933), Rafter Romance (1933) with Ginger Rogers and State Fair (1933). He has written several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs.\n\nSome of Foster's directorial efforts include The Sign of Zorro (1958), and the stylish films noir Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948), Woman on the Run (1950) and Journey into Fear (1943). Foster directed Rachel and the Stranger and the Davy Crockett segments of Disneyland that were edited into feature films Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates where he did not accept any interference from Walt Disney.\n\nIn 1967, he directed Brighty of the Grand Canyon, based on a children's novel by Marguerite Henry about a burro in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The film starred Joseph Cotten, Karl Swenson, Dick Foran, and Pat Conway.\n\nIt was rumored that Orson Welles took over direction of Journey Into Fear, which Welles later denied. Foster was the director of the \"My Friend Bonito\" segment of Orson Welles' Pan-American anthology film It's All True until RKO aborted the project.\n\nFoster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including Charlie Chan in Panama (1940), Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939), Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Charlie Chan in Reno (1939), Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938), Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938), Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937), and Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937).\n\nFoster was married to Claudette Colbert from 1928 until their divorce in 1935. In 1937, he wed actress Sally Blane, an older sister of Loretta Young. The couple remained married until his death in 1976 from cancer in Santa Monica at the age of 75. They had two children, Robert and Gretchen.\n\nHe is buried in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Norman Foster, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His father was the writer Sergey Mikhalkov (1913) and the brother of Nikita Mikhalkov (1945), who is also a well known Russian filmmaker. Andrei Konchalovsky was a frequent collaborator of Andrei Tarkovsky (1932) earlier in his career. His work has won numerous accolades, including the \"Cannes Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury\", a \"FIPRESCI Award\", two \"Silver Lions\", three \"Golden Eagle Awards\", and a \"Primetime Emmy Award\".\n\nHe studied for ten years at the Moscow Conservatory, preparing for a pianist's career. In 1960, however, he met Andrei Tarkovsky and co-scripted his movie Andrei Rublev (1966). His first full-length feature, The First Teacher (1964), was favourably received in the Soviet Union and screened by numerous film festivals abroad. His second film, Asya Klyachina's Story (1967), was suppressed by Soviet authorities. When issued twenty years later, it was acclaimed as his masterpiece. Thereupon, Konchalovsky filmed adaptations of Ivan Turgenev's A Nest of Gentle Folk (1969) and Chekhov's Uncle Vanya (1970), with Innokenty Smoktunovsky in the title role. His epic Siberiade upon its 1979 release was favourably received at Cannes and made possible his move to the United States in 1980.\n\nHis most popular Hollywood releases are Maria's Lovers (1984), Runaway Train (1985), based on a script by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, and Tango & Cash (1989), starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. In the 1990s, Konchalovsky returned to Russia, although he occasionally produced historical films for U.S. television, such as his adaption of The Odyssey (1997) and the award-winning remake, The Lion in Winter (2003).\n\nKonchalovsky's full-length feature, House of Fools (2003), with a cameo role by Bryan Adams as himself, set in a Chechen psychiatric asylum during the war, won him a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2010, Konchalovsky released a longtime passion project of his, The Nutcracker in 3D, a musical adaptation of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet. A musical film, it mixed live action and 3D animation, and starred Elle Fanning, John Turturro, Nathan Lane, and Richard E. Grant. The film was scored with music from the ballet, with additional lyrics by Tim Rice. In 2012, Konchalovsky wrote, directed and produced \"The Battle for Ukraine\", which provided an in depth analysis of how Ukraine to this day struggles to escape from the close embrace of its former big brother. His film \"The Postman's White Nights\" won the Silver Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The script is centred around the true story of Aleksey Tryaptisyn, a real life postman based in a remote Russian village surrounding the Kenozero lake. In 2016 \"Paradise\" directed by him won the Silver Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. It was selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. In 2020 at the 77th Venice film festival, his film \"Dear Comrades\" won a special jury prize.",

He is best known for his extensive directorship and focus on western films.\n\nKane began his career as a professional cellist. In 1934 he took an interest in film directing and, starting in 1935, he co-directed serials for Mascot Pictures and Republic Pictures. He soon became Republic's top Western film director.\n\nKane's first directorial credit was for The Fighting Marines (1935). When Mascot Pictures and several other small film companies amalgamated into Republic Pictures in 1935, Kane became staff director, remaining at the studio until it ceased production in 1958. He piloted many Gene Autry and Roy Rogers movies and directed John Wayne in films such as The Lawless Nineties (1936) and Flame of Barbary Coast (1944), and Joseph Schildkraut on The Cheaters (1945). Between 1935 and his death in 1975 he directed 119 films and numerous television series episodes.\n\nUnlike most Republic house directors, Kane was also credited as associate producer on many of his films. Between 1939-57 he was a major film producer, producing over 60 films. Kane was also a film editor and screenwriter responsible for the editing process of over 20 of his films, and he had a brief stint as an actor.\n\nDuring the 1950s Kane worked steadily in television, with emphasis on Westerns and action series. He spent the last decade of his life as a second-unit director on such productions as Universal Studios Beau Geste (1966) and In Enemy Country (1968).\n\nKane died on August 25, 1975, in Santa Monica, California.",

Upon graduating from England's National Film and Television School in 1990, Hewitt flew to Hollywood with his BAFTA award-winning short film, The Candy Show, in hand. Once there, he called executives from major U.S. studios and asked if he could show them his film. Soon after, he landed an agent and made his feature film directorial debut with Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. Although not as big a success as the original, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the movie made a profit.  He turned to TV next, directing the first two hours of the mini-series Wild Palms. He directed Disney's Tom and Huck in 1995 which was based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Hewitt returned to Britain to film The Borrowers, loosely based on a children's novel by Mary Norton of the same name. He remained in England to helm Whatever Happened to Harold Smith? (1999), then tried his hand at TV work again with The Princess of Thieves (2001), filmed in Romania but featuring a mostly British cast, including a young Keira Knightley as Robin Hood's daughter, Gwyn.  Hewitt co-wrote the script for his next film, Thunderpants. It was filmed in the U.K.",

    "biography": "Akira Kurosawa (Japanese: \u9ed2\u6fa4 \u660e, Hepburn: Kurosawa Akira, March 23, 1910 \u2013 September 6, 1998) was a Japanese filmmaker and painter who directed 30 films in a career spanning over five decades. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production.\n\nKurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another fifteen films.\n\nRashomon (1950), which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), Yojimbo (1961) and High and Low (1963). After the 1960s he became much less prolific; even so, his later work\u2014including two of his final films, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)\u2014continued to receive great acclaim.\n\nIn 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Akira Kurosawa , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After the genre's popularity quickly died out, Sollima was among the first ones to move to spaghetti westerns. The Big Gundown (starring Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian) was released in 1966 with big success, despite the fact that it had to compete with Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Sergio Corbucci's Django. Sollima soon filmed two more westerns. Face to Face (Milian and Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) was released in 1967 and Run, Man, Run! (Milian) in 1968. Although Sollima directed only three westerns and they never reached the level of popularity as the ones by the other Sergios (Leone and Corbucci), each of them are highly regarded among genre enthusiasts.\n\nIn 1970, Sollima switched genres again and directed the Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas starred Violent City, which was one of the first violent and fast-paced Italian crime films often known as poliziotteschi. Like for all of his westerns, the soundtrack was provided by Ennio Morricone. Sollima's last well-known film is Revolver, a poliziotteschi film starring Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sergio Sollima, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was the brother of cartoonist Charles Berberian. He began his career in the audiovisual field, working as an editor at Canal+.\n\nHis first feature film was the comedy La Cit\u00e9 de la peur, which was hit in France. Based on a script by Les Nuls, the film describes a series of murders in Cannes. Berb\u00e9rian returned in 1998 with Paparazzi, starring Vincent Lindon and Patrick Timsit. The film follows the life of a night watchman (Timsit) who is fired after being photographed at a soccer game, instead of being at his job. He then meets Michel (Lindon), who teaches him how to be a paparazzo.\n\nIn 2000, Berb\u00e9rian directed Six-Pack, a thriller with Richard Anconina who stalks a serial-killer to the four corners of Paris. Returning in 2002 with the comedy Le Boulet, starring G\u00e9rard Lanvin and Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde, a prison guard (Poelvoorde) has to team up with a convict (Lanvin) to retrieve a lotto ticket from the latter.\n\nThen in 2004, Berb\u00e9rian paired Christian Clavier and Jean Reno in the comedy, The Corsican File, based on a comic book of the same name by Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9tillon, in which a detective is responsible for locating a man living in Corsica who is owed an inheritance. In 2007, he reunited G\u00e9rard Jugnot and Jean-Paul Rouve in L'\u00cele aux tr\u00e9sors.\n\nBerb\u00e9rian died in Paris, France, on 22 August 2017, at the age of 64.\n\nSource: Article \"Alain Berb\u00e9rian\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",

Subsequently, Negret's talent was recognized and highlighted by The Hollywood Reporter as part of their 'Top 10 Latino Directors to watch'.\n\nSubsequent to the \"Towards Darkness\" premiere, Negret developed the script for \"Operation Checkmate,\" a thriller for Screen Gems about the real-life rescue of Ingrid Betancourt. He also directed two feature films - \"Seconds Apart\" and \"Transit.\" \"Seconds Apart,\" an After Dark Films production, was released by Lionsgate. The film stars Orlando Jones (Runaway Jury, Evolution) as a detective trying to solve a series of mysterious deaths connected to a pair of twins.\n\n\"Transit\" stars Jim Caviezel(Passion of the Christ, The Count of Monte Cristo), James Frain (Tron:Legacy, Trueblood), Harold Perrnieau (Lost, Romeo+Juliet) and Elisabeth Rhom (Heroes, Miss Congeniality 2). \"Transit\" is executive produced by Joel Silver (Sherlock Homes, The Matrix).\n\nEarly in his career, Negret directed multiple award winning short films. He also directed two seasons of the weekly television series \"Not So Foreign Filmmakers Showcase.\" The show encompassed sketches and interviews with celebrity guests, among which included Virginia Madsen, Rosario Dawson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jay Hernandez, and Robert Rodriguez.\n\nNegret has lived and worked in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, England, and the United States.

Though not a failure, KIM would then score his first hit with the period detective action-comedy Detective K: Secret of Virtuous Widow in 2011. Featuring KIM Myung-min as a bumbling but efficient detective in the Joseon Era, alongside with his sidekick played by OH Dal-su. Released during the Lunar New Year, the film racked up over 4.7 million admissions. Following that success, KIM briefly returned to television by directing the K-drama Live in Cheongdam-Dong, which aired its 170 episodes from the end of 2011 into the middle of 2012. Teaming up again with KIM and OH, director KIM sought to strike gold once more with a sequel to his earlier hit in 2015, entitled Detective K: Secret of the Lost Island. The film met with a similar critical consensus and audience enthusiasm as the blockbuster period film scored a robust 3.8 million viewers, once again in the Lunar New Year frame.",

His films have earned him a variety of Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Palme d'Or Awards and he has been nominated for Emmy and Grammy Awards. In 2007, Total Film named him the 12th-greatest director of all time.\n\nTarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Connie McHugh Tarantino Zastoupil, a health care executive and nurse born in Knoxville, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and amateur musician born in Queens, New York. Tarantino's mother allowed him to quit school at age 17, to attend an acting class full time. Tarantino gave up acting while attending the acting school, saying that he admired directors more than actors. Tarantino also worked in a video rental store before becoming a filmmaker, paid close attention to the types of films people liked to rent, and has cited that experience as inspiration for his directorial career.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Quentin Tarantino, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

From 1998 onwards, he began directing feature films, although he has worked on a few music videos since then. In a tribute article for TIME magazine, Fuqua expressed his early respect for Kurosawa as a filmmaker and how Kurosawa influenced his own perspective on filmmaking stating: \"(screenwriter Hashimoto's) \u2026 working with Akira Kurosawa and Hideo Oguni, was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys\".\n\nHis first feature film was the John Woo-produced action film The Replacement Killers (1998), starring Chow Yun Fat. He then directed the crime thriller Training Day (2001), for which star Denzel Washington won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His next films were the action war drama Tears of the Sun (2003), the Arthurian legend film King Arthur (2004), the conspiracy action thriller Shooter (2007), the crime film Brooklyn's Finest (2009), and the action thrillers Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and The Equalizer (2014), the latter of which again pairs Fuqua with Denzel Washington.\n\nHe co-created the comic-book miniseries After Dark with Wesley Snipes, which was written by Peter Milligan and illustrated by Jeff Nentrup. Fuqua was scheduled to direct Prisoners, based on a storybook from Aaron Guzikowski, but left the project. He was slated to direct Tupac Shakur's official biopic. The project was postponed to allow Fuqua to direct rapper Eminem's second feature film, Southpaw. However, Eminem put Southpaw on hold to focus on music and was replaced with Jake Gyllenhaal. In 2010, CBS Films hired Fuqua to direct a new movie based on a Vince Flynn novel, Consent to Kill. In May 2014, 20th Century Fox set Fuqua to direct a drug-smuggling thriller film Narco Sub, which is scripted by David Guggenheim.",

He was known for the innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence, as well as his revisionist approach to the Western genre.\n\nPeckinpah's films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals, and the corruption of violence in human society. He was given the nickname \"Bloody Sam\" owing to the violence in his films. His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable, but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.\n\nPeckinpah's combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, has often overshadowed his professional legacy. Many of his films were noted for behind-the-scenes battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime. Many of his films, such as Straw Dogs (1971), Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (1973) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), remain controversial.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sam Peckinpah, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After graduating from high school in his hometown of Layton, Utah, Tran directed a short film titled \"Monstrosity\" that toured the nation in the film festival circuit and gained recognition from managers and agents in Los Angeles. This recognition prompted Tran to move to Hollywood, California with his producing partner Laura Young.\n\nTwo months later Tran was signed by a manager and was introduced to his agent at Creative Artists Agency (CAA). In 2014, he landed a role in the Disney Channel original movie \"Cloud 9.\" Being on the other side of the camera helped him grow as a director on the technical side and also in how to direct actors more effectively.\n\nSince arriving in Hollywood, Tran has made his mark on many projects. He directed and edited a four episode web-series for Jennette McCurdy titled \"What's Next For Sarah.\" He also directed and produced several music videos for The Girl and The Dreamcatcher (Dove Cameron & Ryan McCartan), which all premiered on Disney Channel. He later collaborated with Awesomeness TV and directed an episode of their horror anthology series \"Sleep Tight\" before being cast in a horror film titled \"Nocturne,\" which premiered on Showtime.\n\nMost recently, Tran debuted his new mini-series \"Scarytale Ending\" with a teaser of his first episode, a short film titled \"Cruella.\" He directed and edited \"Killer Date,\" an award-winning short film on the festival circuit and he also directed a music video for Todrick Hall's \"I Like Boys.\" As an actor, Tran was cast in the most recent seasons of Freeform's \"Grownish\" and Netflix's \"GLOW.\"\n\nToday, Tran continues to carve out work as a filmmaker and creator. \"8 Bodies,\" a dark horror comedy, is a feature film scheduled to begin production soon. Tran is also spearheading a second feature film, a stylized slasher titled \"Spook,\" expected to begin production next year.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nWilliam Beaudine (January 15, 1892 \u2013 March 18, 1970) was an American film actor and director. He was one of Hollywood's most prolific directors, turning out films in remarkable numbers and in a wide variety of genres.\n\nIn 1915 he was hired as an actor and director by the Kalem Company. He was an assistant to director D.W. Griffith on The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. By the time he was 23 Beaudine had directed his first picture, a short called Almost a King (1915). He would continue to direct shorts exclusively until 1922, when he shifted his efforts into making feature-length films.\n\nBeaudine directed silent films for Goldwyn Pictures (before it became part of MGM), Metro Pictures (also before MGM), First National Pictures, Principal and Warner Brothers. In 1926 he made Sparrows, the story of orphans imprisoned in a swamp farm starring Mary Pickford. Beaudine had at least 30 pictures to his credit before the sound era began. Among his first sound films were short Mack Sennett comedies; he made at least one film for Sennett while contractually bound elsewhere, resulting in his adopting the pseudonym \"William Crowley.\" He would occasionally use the pseudonym in later years, usually as \"William X. Crowley.\"\n\nHe ground out several movies annually for Fox Films, Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Universal Pictures. His most famous credit of the early 1930s is The Old-Fashioned Way, a comedy about old-time show folks starring W. C. Fields.\n\nBeaudine was one of a number of experienced directors (including Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan) who were brought to England from Hollywood in the 1930s to work on what were in all other respects very British productions. Beaudine directed four films there starring Will Hay, including Boys Will Be Boys (1935) and Where There's a Will (1936).\n\nBeaudine was often entrusted with series films, including the Torchy Blane, The East Side Kids, Jiggs and Maggie, The Shadow, Charlie Chan and The Bowery Boys series. His efficiency was so well known that Walt Disney hired him to direct some of his television projects of the 1950s and had him direct a feature western, Ten Who Dared (1960). Beaudine became even busier in TV, directing Naked City, The Green Hornet, and dozens of Lassie episodes.\n\nHis last two feature films, both released in 1966, were the horror-westerns Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (with John Carradine) and Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter. By the end of the decade he was the industry's oldest working professional, having started in 1909.\n\nBeaudine died of uremic poisoning in 1970 in California and was interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood.",

After immigrating to America, the family's surname was changed from Rabinovitch to \"Fuller\" possibly by inspiration of a Doctor who arrived in America on the Mayflower.  At the age of 12, he began working in journalism  as a newspaper  copyboy. He became a crime reporter  in New York City at age 17, working for the New York Evening Graphic. He broke the story of Jeanne Eagels' death.  He wrote pulp novels and screenplays  from the mid-1930s onwards. Fuller also became a screenplay  ghostwriter  but would never tell interviewers which screenplays that he ghost-wrote explaining \"that's what a ghost writer is for\".\n\nDuring World War II, Fuller joined the United States Army infantry. He was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and saw heavy fighting. He was involved in landings in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy  and also saw action in Belgium and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was present at the liberation of the German concentration camp at Falkenau  and shot 16 mm footage which was used later in the documentary Falkenau: The Impossible. For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart.  Fuller used his wartime experiences as material in his films, especially in The Big Red One (1980), a nickname of the 1st Infantry Division.\n\nAfter his controversial film \"White Dog\" was shelved by Paramount pictures, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film. Fuller eventually returned to America. He died of natural causes in his California home. In November 1997, the Directors Guild held a three hour memorial in his honor, hosted by Curtis Hanson, his long time friend and co-writer on White Dog. He was survived by his wife Christa and daughter Samantha.",

He joined P.C.L. (a precursor to Toho) in 1933 and began working as an assistant director to Kajir\u014d Yamaguchi alongside his longtime friend, acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa. He made his feature film directing debut in 1947 with Snow Trail, which was written by Kurosawa. Snow Trial starred Toshir\u014d Mifune in his film debut and actress Setsuko Wakayama. It helped establish Taniguchi's reputation for action film.\n\nTaniguchi and Wakayama married in 1949 (he had earlier been married to the screenwriter Y\u014dko Mizuki), but the couple divorced in 1956. Taniguchi married his second wife, actress Kaoru Yachigusa, in 1957. Yachigusa and Taniguchi remained together for over fifty years until his death in 2007.\n\nTaniguchi was the screenwriter for the 1949 film, The Quiet Duel, which Kurosawa directed and which also starred Mifune. His most acclaimed film as a director was Escape at Dawn, a controversial anti-war work from 1950 about a Japanese soldier and a \"comfort woman\" that got into trouble with Occupation era censors. Taniguchi continued to direct movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but the quality of his work declined. His films from the time period include Man Against Man, The Gambling Samurai, Man In The Storm and The Lost World of Sinbad. His 1965 film International Secret Police: Key of Keys has been famously re-dubbed and re-released as What's Up, Tiger Lily? by Woody Allen. He was chosen as the supervising director of the official documentary of Expo '70.\n\nSenkichi Taniguchi died of pneumonia at a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, on October 29, 2007, at the age of 95.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Senkichi Taniguchi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He was born in Aldershot, Hampshire.\n\nThe son of an army officer, he attended Charterhouse School as a boy, graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and worked for some years as an actor, director and stage manager.

Robbery (1967), a crime thriller, is a fictionalised version of the Great Train Robbery of 1963. This led to Bullitt (1968), of which Bruce Weber has written, \"Mr. Yates\u2019s reputation probably rests most securely on \u201cBullitt\u201d (1968), his first American film \u2014 and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.\"\n\nYates was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Direction for Bullitt (1968). Yates produced and directed Breaking Away (1979), which was nominated for five Academy Awards (\"Oscars\") including Best Director and Best Film for Yates. Yates also produced and directed The Dresser (1983), which was an adaptation of the Ronald Harwood stage play. The film received seven BAFTA and five Oscar nominations, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film and for Best Direction and the Academy Award for Best Film and for Best Director for Yates.

Rifkin is best known in Hollywood circles for writing family-friendly comedies like Mousehunt and 2007's Underdog. Most recently Rifkin wrote, executive produced and directed all 11 episodes of Look for Showtime. Based on his award winning film of the same name, LOOK is a drama that takes the viewer into the foreboding world of hidden cameras. Armed with the knowledge that Americans are captured on surveillance cameras more than 300 times a day, the topical series, like the film, tells its story exclusively through the eyes of the security cameras, web cams, and cell phone cameras Americans live in front of everyday, bringing to light the realities of what it means to be watched in a camera consumed culture.",

While in Secondary school, he worked part-time in the evenings at the film processing studio of Taiwan Motion Picture Studio. Upon graduation, he continued to work at the company as an assistant cinematographer for six years and later switched to Lucky Star Film Co Ltd to work as a cinematographer for three years, where he shot many Taiwanese-dialect films. In 1966, when Lo Chen went to Taiwan for the location shooting of Too Late for Love (1967), Pao assisted him and gained his recognization. Pao then went to Hong Kong the following year and joined Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd. He first worked as a cinematographer at Shaws, responsible for shooting Lo Chen, Griffin Yue Feng and Chang Cheh's films. Some of the major works included Chang Cheh's The Trail of the Broken Blade (1967) and Golden Swallow (1968); Griffin Yue Feng's Rape of the Sword (1967), Spring Blossoms (1968) and The Silent Love (1971). Pao was acclaimed for his meticulous camerawork and the way he captured the sentiments of the characters. Recommended and encouraged by Chang and Yue, he began his directorial career in 1970. His first film was a horror action film shot in the same year, Finger of Doom (released in 1972), followed by Oath of Death (1971). He directed ten and plus titles for Shaws, of which he co-directed six of them with Chang, including the remarkable The Boxer from Shantung (1972) and Man of Iron (1972). He was deeply influenced by Chang and, like him his forte was action films.\n\nIn 1977, Pao left Shaws and returned to Taiwan to make wuxia films Blooded Treasury Fight (1979) and The Eight Escorts (1980) for companies such as Yen Sheng Film. His wife, Chin Shu-mei, was a scriptwriter for Shaws when he was working there. The two of them later founded Yu Fung Film Company in Taiwan, and produced films directed by Pao, including Heroic One (1981) and Night of the Assassins (1981). (From Hong Kong Film Archive)",

However, in 1975 he moved to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he graduated from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Film School. His film debut was Vabank (1981), a comedy describing a story of two Polish gangsters of the 1930s. The film was a striking success, as was the science-fiction comedy Seksmisja of 1984. Often seen as either a golden child or enfant terrible of the Polish cinema, Machulski quickly became one of the most popular Polish directors, both in Poland and abroad. His film Seksmisja, although significantly shortened by the Soviet censorship, was one of the most popular pictures shown in the Soviet Union in mid-1980s. The movie can be viewed as a satire directed at intergender conflict (wrong-headed feminism or wrong-headed masculism), prudery, or totalitarianism.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Juliusz Machulski, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Damian Robert Chapa (born October 29, 1963) is a Mexican-American actor, film director and film producer.\n\nChapa was born in Dayton, Ohio, USA. He was briefly married to Natasha Henstridge. Among his earlier notable film roles are one of the leads in Taylor Hackford's Blood In Blood Out and the part of Ken in the film adaptation of Street Fighter. Subsequently, Chapa has directed and produced, in addition to starring in, his own films. These movies include 1998's Kill You Twice, 2000's The Lonely Life of Downey Hall, 2002's Man of Faith, 2004's Shade of Pale, 2004's El Padrino, and 2006's I.R.A.: King of Nothing.\n\nChapa co-wrote and directed Polanski Unauthorized, a biopic of Roman Polanski, in which he played the title role. It was released on February 13, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Chapa will begin filming the only film about Marlon Brando ever to be made, in June 2010 called Brando Unauthorized. He followed this with \"Vatos Locos\", starring himself. Albert Pyun was supposed to direct, but left the project following a dispute over his salary, so Chapa directed himself. The film is about the Chinese mafia in Los Angeles and how the Mexican gang boys, known as \"vatos,\" fought back and defeated the Chinese gang-bangers.\n\nAs of 2011, Chapa has yet another project in development, an indie drama titled \"The Best So Far,\" which takes place in the late 80's, about a small-town Canadian girl who loves Judo and dreams about being one of the finalists at the '88 Olympics. The ensemble drama follows the lines of Rocky, in the sense that it's not about winning, but going the distance and getting your life back. Chapa, who wrote the drama, will play the widowed father, who does his best to make life easier for his daughter. Although the film is in its very early development stages, Chapa hopes the script will attract the interest of talented artists such as Ellen Page for the main role and Jennifer Connelly for the supporting role, this being the part of the final, toughest competition Page's character faces off during the '88 Olympics and gets defeated by. Although not winning, she gets her sense of victory be offering a brave stand against the better fighter, and both discover, in the process, they are quite simillar, despite their differences. Insiders who had a chance to read the script stated that it is one of the finest not-yet-filmed scripts they had ever seen. Acclaimed director David Cronenberg asked for New Line to bid for the script, but Chapa wouldn't sell it, because of his determination to direct the picture himself. The project is slated to be shot sometime in mid-2012, for tentative release in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Damian Chapa, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He also contributed to the school's weekly, El Vaquero, receiving several JACC student journalism awards for his work as editorial cartoonist, entertainment editor and editor-in-chief.\n\nLauzirika later attended the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, where he wrote and directed a fully funded 16mm sync sound film in the program's CNTV 480 Advanced Production Workshop; Lauzirika graduated in 1994.  While attending USC film school, Lauzirika concurrently worked for numerous film companies, including Lucasfilm Ltd., Lightstorm Entertainment, Warner Bros., Silver Pictures and Scott Free Productions. \n\nWhile working as a story analyst for directors Ridley Scott and Tony Scott, Lauzirika was chosen by Ridley Scott to supervise and produce elaborate DVD special editions of Scott's classic films. Lauzirika's works have been nominated for Video and DVD Premiere Awards, and in 2003 his comprehensive nine-disc Alien Quadrilogy garnered the DVDX Award for Best Overall DVD, Classic Movie. In 2008, Lauzirika won two Saturn Awards for his work on Blade Runner (Best DVD Special Edition) and Twin Peaks (Best Retro Television Release). And in 2011, he won his third Saturn Award for the Alien Anthology (Best DVD Movie Collection.)  \n\nLauzirika has been in charge of the restorations and new cuts of such as films as Alien\u00b3, Legend and Blade Runner: The Final Cut, each project requiring new visual effects and additional scenes which had to seamlessly blend in with existing footage. \n\nHe has also directed several commercials and short films, as well as the music video for Montell Jordan's When You Get Home (1998) which featured Billy Dee Williams. Lauzirika himself occasionally serves as camera operator in his documentary interviews, thereby fostering a more intimate environment, allowing the interviewee to be more sharing on camera. \n\nAlthough his work has long been associated with the films of Ridley Scott, Lauzirika has also produced DVD content for the works of numerous other directors, including David Lynch, Sam Raimi, James Cameron, the Coen brothers, Michael Bay, David Fincher, Robert Rodriguez, Marc Webb, John Badham, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Mark Romanek and Tony Scott.  \n\nIn 2010, Empire Magazine reported that Lauzirika was working on a comprehensive Blu-ray release of the four Alien films, now known as the Alien Anthology. In addition to creating new content, he also oversaw a new sound mix of the Alien\u00b3 Special Edition which necessitated the return of certain actors to re-record their dialogue due to the poor production sound heard in the film's original rough assembly. In 2011 it was reported that Lauzirika was working on DVD/Blu-ray special editions for such films as Transformers: Dark of the Moon, The Amazing Spider-Man and Prometheus.\n\nLauzirika made his feature directorial debut with the psychological thriller Crave which stars Josh Lawson, Emma Lung, Edward Furlong and Ron Perlman. Lauzirika is also one of the film's producers and co-wrote the screenplay.  ",

Later, he switched to filmmaking and made his debut in 1978, directing A Different Story, starring Perry King and Meg Foster. The film turned out to be a \"cult classic.\" After years of directing films, he began producing his films in 1986.\n\nAfter finishing his education at Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont, he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the show business. There, he became the Casting and New Programs Director for the Mark Taper Forum.

He also worked in New York to direct the successful, off-Broadway rock musical hit, \"Salvation\", featuring, among others, Bette Midler, Barry Bostwick, and Joe Morton. He next moved to Broadway to direct the comedy \"Paris Is Out\", starring Sam Levene and Molly Picon, becoming the youngest director in Broadway history. After moving back to the West Coast, Aaron directed the revival of Paddy Chayefsky's, \"The Tenth Man\", starring Richard Dreyfuss.

Also in 1979, he directed the hit NBC TV movie The Miracle Worker, starring Patty Duke, Melissa Gilbert, and Diana Muldaur. For his work, he was nominated for \"Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Specials/Movies for TV/Actuality\" at the 1980 Directors Guild of America Award. He also won the Director's prize from the Monte Carlo Film Festival, a Golden Globe nomination, and the Christopher Award. The film was nominated for four Emmys and won three, including one for Patty Duke as \"Lead Actress in a Dramatic Special\" and the Emmy as \"Outstanding Dramatic Special\" of the 1979-1980 season.\n\nIn 1981, he directed CBS' TV movie Thin Ice (1981), starring Kate Jackson and Lillian Gish.\n\nIn 1987, he directed the award-winning NBC television special, In Love and War (1987), the story of United States Navy vice admiral James Stockdale, which starred James Woods and Jane Alexander.

A noted wit and raconteur, he was a fixture on television talk shows and lecture circuits for much of his career. He was also a respected intellectual and diplomat who, in addition to his various academic posts, served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF and President of the World Federalist Movement.  Ustinov was the winner of numerous awards over his life, including two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor, Emmy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards for acting, a Grammy Award for best recording for children, as well the recipient of governmental honours from, amongst others, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. He displayed a unique cultural versatility that has frequently earned him the accolade of a Renaissance man. Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, composer of the music for Quo Vadis and of numerous concert works, dedicated his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 22 (1950) to Ustinov.  In 2003, shortly before his death in 2004, Durham University renamed its Graduate Society as Ustinov College in honour of the significant contributions Sir Peter had made while serving as Chancellor of the University from 1992 onwards.

The film became Chile's highest grossing movie and was selected as its official candidate for both the \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category in the 1993 Academy Awards, as well as the Spanish Goya Awards that same year. In the US, the film premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival where it became an instant success and was commercially released in the US to rave reviews from the indie press. Crowning its success, the film was invited to participate in A-list festivals such as Tokyo International Film Festival, New Directors New Films at the MOMA in New York, Toronto, and other prestigious festivals like Montreal, Los Angeles, San Sebastian, Munich, London, Stockholm, V'iennale, Sydney, Rio; and winning numerous awards including the Chilean film critics' Best Movie of the Year and 1st place at the \"Mystery Film Festival\" in Italy. \"Johnny\" went on to obtain worldwide distribution.\n\nHis prestige as an international filmmaker has also led Gustavo to become President of the Jury of the Latin American Cinema Award at the Sundance Film Festival 1999.\n\nGustavo's desire to become a filmmaker started at an early age. After attending law school at the prestigious Universidad Catolica in Chile, he left to pursue his film career as a student at the highly selective and celebrated HFF -Munich Film and Television University- in Germany, where he spent five years. He remained in Germany where he developed a career as a screenwriter and director, beginning with films such as \"Filming with Douglas Sirk\" -a documentary about the master of melodrama in Hollywood, featuring the late great post-war German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Gustavo directed in Germany his first English language feature, \"The voice\", with British actors Jon Finch and Suzanna Hamilton, and late rock star Ian Dury.\n\nGustavo returned to Chile after 15 years in Europe to write, produce and direct \"Johnny 100 Pesos\". With this success under his belt he was invited to work in the United States and offered his first American feature \"Diplomatic Siege\" starring Darryl Hannah, Peter Weller and Tom Berenger. His second American film \"Instinct to kill\" features martial arts star Mark Dacascos.\n\nGustavo has most recently been directing, writing and producing greatly admired big budget movies for Chilean TV like \"Balmaceda,\" for which he won the Altazor Television award in the best drama category. His next TV movie \"Prat\" reached a record audience in that country. In 2017 he directs and produces \"Johnny 100 Pesos - Chapter Two\".",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nWilliam Girdler (October 22, 1947 - January 21, 1978) was an American filmmaker. In a span of seven years, from 1972 to 1978, he directed nine feature films in such genres as horror and action. Girdler also wrote and produced three of his features, Abby, Sheba, Baby and The Manitou.\n\nGirdler, born in Louisville, Kentucky started Studio One Productions in his early twenties, and directed his first feature a low-budget film entitled Asylum of Satan which was briefly released to theaters. Girdler's second effort was a gory, if overlong slasher thriller entitled Three on a Meathook. Both Asylum of Satan and Three on a Meathook were filmed in his home town, and although both films received little notice, the films got the attention of Samuel Z. Arkoff and American International Pictures (AIP).\n\nGirdler next directed three \"blaxploitation\" films. The first, in 1973, was a long lost thriller titled The Zebra Killer starring Austin Stoker. By coincidence, another Louisville native, Rich Miles, appeared in this picture in a small role as the local cop who discovers some of the bodies. Girdler's next feature was an Exorcist clone titled Abby with Carol Speed in the lead role and co-starring William H. Marshall (from Blacula) and Oscar nominee Juanita Moore. Abby became Girdler's breakthrough film. The picture opened in 1974 to major box office success, earning nearly $9 million. Warner Brothers thought Abby was too derivative of Exorcist and the film was suddenly pulled from theaters after two weeks. The last \"blaxploitation\" film Girdler directed was the Pam Grier vehicle Sheba, Baby and his first effort in the action genre. Sheba, Baby was another major hit in theaters, even though it is often cited as one of Pam Grier's more weaker vehicles than her other similar themed action films Coffy and Foxy Brown. Girdler was then finished with his contract with Arkoff and AIP.\n\nGirdler's sixth feature was another action themed film starring Leslie Nielsen, in one of his more serious roles as an agent tracked by the government in the political thriller Project: Kill, which was given a limited theatrical release.\n\nGrizzly, released in 1976, was Girdler's most financially successful film. A Jaws clone from start to finish, the film was about an oversized grizzly bear terrorizing a National Park. The movie starred Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel and went on to become one of the most successful motion pictures of the year, earning an impressive $39 million worldwide. After this triumph, Grizzly's producer and distributor, Edward L. Montoro and Film Ventures International decided to keep the financial profits. Girdler (and the film's screenwriters/producers Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon, who also worked with Girdler on previous films) sued Montoro and Film Ventures to have the profits returned. Girdler directed The Day of the Animals, another effort for Montoro which is sometimes cited as a sequel to Grizzly. The film had an all-star cast including Christopher George, Leslie Nielsen, Richard Jaeckel, Ruth Roman and Lynda Day George. It was Girdler's second approach to nature-versus-man films, but was not as successful as Grizzly.\n\nThe Manitou was the last film directed by Girdler. Based on a best selling novel by Graham Masterton, and starring Tony Curtis and Susan Strasberg, The Manitou was perhaps Girdler's most expensive production. It was acquired by AVCO Embassy Pictures and released in 1978 and was also a major hit in theaters. He was killed in a helicopter crash in Manila, Philippines on January 21, 1978, while scouting locations for his tenth film project.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article William Girdler, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Steven Allan Spielberg (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, writer and producer. A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, he is the most commercially successful director of all time. Spielberg is the recipient of various accolades, including three Academy Awards, a Kennedy Center honor, four Directors Guild of America Awards, two BAFTA Awards, a Cecil B. DeMille Award and an AFI Life Achievement Award. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\nSpielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television including Night Gallery and Columbo, he directed the television film Duel (1971) which gained acclaim from critics and audiences. He made his directorial film debut with The Sugarland Express (1974), and became a household name with the 1975 summer blockbuster Jaws. He then directed huge box office successes Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and the Indiana Jones original trilogy (1981-89). Spielberg subsequently explored drama in the acclaimed The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987).\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, Spielberg directed the science fiction thriller Jurassic Park (1993), the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993), which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter and for the 1998 World War II epic Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg continued in the 2000s with science fiction films A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005). He also directed the adventure films The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Ready Player One (2018); the historical dramas Amistad (1997), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017); the musical West Side Story (2021); and the semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans (2022). He has been a producer on several successful films, including Poltergeist (1982), Gremlins (1984), Back to the Future (1985) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) as well as the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001).\n\nSpielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks, and has served as a producer for many successful films and television series. He is also known for his long collaboration with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films. Several of Spielberg's works are among the highest-grossing and greatest films all time. Premiere ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies in 2003. In 2013, Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people.",

He would then have four or five movies while having spent the budget of one. Ho states this style of filmmaking was enforced on him by producer Joseph Lai.\n\nHe effectively retired from direction after 25 years making genre films in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Phillipines, he was most recently teaching filmmaking at Hong Kong Film Academy.",

    "biography": "Michael D. Moore (born Dennis Michael Sheffield, October 14, 1914 \u2013 March 4, 2013) was a Canadian-born American film director, second unit director, and child actor, when he was credited as Mickey Moore (or Micky Moore). He was credited as Michael Moore on all the films and TV shows he directed, and on most of the films on which he was second unit director. Born Michael Sheffield in Victoria, British Columbia, both he and his brother Patrick were Hollywood child actors. At the age of five he appeared in his first film under the stage name \"Mickey Moore\". He appeared in two dozen films until 1927 when he was 13. In the early 1950s, Moore began working as an Assistant Film Director and would fill that role or as a Second unit director on more than sixty films. He played a key part in a number of major motion pictures including The Ten Commandments, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Patton, and The Man Who Would Be King in 1975. He also worked as an assistant director on several Elvis Presley musical films and directed Presley in the 1966 film, Paradise, Hawaiian Style for Paramount Pictures. Because of that, plus his experience directing a western film, MGM hired him to direct rock singer Roy Orbison in 1967's The Fastest Guitar Alive. He was the associate producer in charge of action & animal scenes for Quest for Fire. In the 1980s, Steven Spielberg hired Moore as assistant director for both the second and third Indiana Jones films. Moore worked as second unit director on Raiders of the Lost Ark. His association with Spielberg also led him to direct one episode (\"Alamo Jobe\") in the acclaimed TV series Amazing Stories. Well into his eighties, Moore was still active, his most recent work being as the second unit director for Disney's 2000 film, 102 Dalmatians.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael D.

The talents of versatile Russian writer/director Kirill Sokolov were brought to the attention of Western audiences via the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in Estonia in 2018. A riotous, action-filled black comedy, Sokolov's debut film, \"Why Don't You Just Die?,\" draws upon the cinematic styles of his favorite directors, Sergio Leone, Martin McDonagh, Park Chan-wook, Martin Scorsese, and, of course, Quentin Tarantino. Although his first full-length feature film is distinctly Russian, uniquely characterized as a Western-style action film playing out within the confines of a Moscow apartment, Sokolov endeavors to tell a universal story that international audiences will still be able to relate to.\n\nSokolov was born in 1989 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2012, he received a master's degree in the Physics and Technology of Nanostructures. However, even as he worked to complete his degree in Physics, he began making short films with his friends, initially using just ketchup as blood. Inspired by films such as \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\" \"Evil Dead 2,\" \"Oldboy,\" and \"Kill Bill\", Sokolov discovered that he had both a love and a talent for dark comedy, a genre which has yet to gain popularity in Russia. In 2013, when Sokolov's filmmaking hobby started to consume all of his time, he enrolled in a program for Advanced Courses for Film Directors and Scriptwriters (VKSR) at the workshop of V. Khotinenko, P. Finn, and V. Fenchenko. In 2015 he successfully defended his diploma with the short film \"The Flame.\" In addition to his debut film, \"Why Don't You Just Die?\" Sokolov has edited several Russian full-length feature films, written several full-length screenplays, and directed music videos and commercials.",

    "biography": "Bert Ira Gordon (born September 24, 1922 in Kenosha, WI) was an American film director most famous for such science fiction and horror B-movies as The Amazing Colossal Man and Village of the Giants.\n\nMost of Gordon's work was in the idiom of giant monster films, for which he used rear-projection to create the special effects. His nickname \"Mister B.I.G.\" was a reference both to his initials and to his preferred technique for making super-sized creatures.\n\nGordon held a degree from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He began his career directing television commercials before moving to film in 1954 to produce Serpent Island. In 1957, he began his prolific association with American International Pictures.\n\nIn 1960, he wrote, produced and directed The Boy and the Pirates, starring then active and popular child star Charles Herbert alongside Gordon's own daughter, Susan. The trio recently appeared together in the celebrity lineup at the 2006 Monster Bash, held June 23-25 at the Pittsburgh (PA) Airport Four Points, as The Walt Disney Company's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) spiked interest in previous \"pirate\" films. To that end, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, released a Midnite Movies double DVD set with the rarely seen The Boy and the Pirates, and the more recent Crystalstone (1988), on June 27, 2006.\n\nHis 1977 Empire of the Ants featured a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins, who later said of the film that it was her worst acting experience, but by then the loosely-based modernized H. G. Wells tale had been elevated to cult film status.\n\nWhile none of his films received significant critical attention, his work attained popularity in some circles. Cult TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) has featured several of his films, which the accompanying episodes are often regarded as some of the show's best.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bert I.

Niblo was born Frederick Liedtke (several sources give \"Frederico Nobile\", apparently erroneously) in York, Nebraska, to a French mother and a father who had served as a captain in the American Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. Using the stage name, Fred Niblo, Liedtke began his show business career performing in vaudeville and in live theater. After more than twenty years doing live performing as a monologist, during which he traveled extensively around the globe, he worked in Australia from 1912 through 1915, where he turned to the burgeoning motion picture industry and made his first two films.\n\nAs a Hollywood director, he is most remembered for several notable films beginning with his 1920 work The Mark of Zorro which starred Douglas Fairbanks. The following year he teamed up with Fairbanks again in The Three Musketeers and then directed Rudolph Valentino in Blood and Sand.\n\nIn 1924, Niblo directed the film Thy Name Is Woman. In 1925, Niblo was the principal director of the epic Ben-Hur that was one of the most expensive films of the day but became the third highest-grossing silent film in cinema history. Niblo followed up on this success with two major 1926 works, The Temptress starring Greta Garbo in her second film in America, and Norma Talmadge in Camille. Niblo went on to direct some of the greatest stars of the era including Joan Crawford, Lillian Gish, and Ronald Colman. In 1930 he directed his first talkie with two of the biggest names in show business, John Gilbert and Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e in a film titled Redemption.\n\nFred Niblo retired in 1933 after more than forty years in show business. The last sixteen years were used to make more than forty films, most of which were feature length projects. He was an important personality in the early years of Hollywood and was one of the original founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In recognition of his role in the development of the film industry, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7014 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960. His Ben-Hur film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nFred Niblo died in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near his wife Enid Bennett in Glendale, California. His son with Josephine Cohan, Fred Niblo, Jr. (1903\u20131973) was a successful Hollywood screenwriter.",

Wishing to become a director, he joined Chiez\u014d Kataoka's Chiez\u014d Productions and made his directorial debut in 1928 with Tenka taiheiki. Returning to Nikkatsu, he continued making jidaigeki and participated in the Naritaki Group of young filmmakers such as Sadao Yamanaka and Fuji Yahiro who collaboratively wrote screenplays under the made up name \"Kinpachi Kajiwara\". Like others in the group, Inagaki was known for his cheerful and intelligent samurai films. Inagaki later moved to Daiei and then Toho, where he made big budget color spectacles as well as delicate works depicting the feelings of children.

Hickox was born in London, where he was educated at Emanuel School. Hickox worked extensively as an assistant director and second unit director throughout the 50's and early 60's, making his first major picture in 1970. Over the next ten years, he developed a reputation for the wit and style of his direction, and for his taut action sequences. His work includes Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (1968), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1969), Theatre of Blood (1973) and Zulu Dawn (1979).\n\nHickox was married to Anne V. Coates, the Oscar winning editor of Lawrence of Arabia. After his death in 1988, his second wife Annabel approached the BIFA (British Independent Film Awards) with an annual bequest from Douglas' estate. This bequest led directly to the creation of the British Independent Film Awards. In recognition of Douglas's commitment and support for new talent, BIFA inaugurated the Douglas Hickox Award, which is given to a British director on their debut feature.\n\nDouglas Hickox's sons, Anthony Hickox and James D.R. Hickox are also film directors and one of his daughters, Emma, a film editor. Anthony Hickox's best known work is perhaps Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992), whilst he was Executive Producer on Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995) directed by James D.R. Hickox. Emma E. Hickox's career has probably taken her the furthest though with films like The Jacket, Kinky Boots, Blood and Chocolate, Blue Crush, Becoming Jane and A Walk to Remember on her CV.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Douglas Hickox, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: \u70ae\u70ae, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.",

    "biography": "Roy Ward Baker is an English film director born in London on 19 December 1916. His best known film is A Night to Remember which won a Golden Globe for best foreign English language film in 1959. His later career was varied, and included many horror films and television shows.\n\nBaker's early career, from 1934 to 1939, was spent working for Gainsborough Pictures, a British film production company based in Islington, North London, famous for its prestige productions. His first jobs were menial - making tea for crew members, for example - but by 1938 he had risen through the ranks to work as assistant director on Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.\n\nHe served in the army during World War II, until transferring to the Army Kinematograph Unit in 1943 in order to make better use of skills developed in his pre-war career producing documentaries and teaching materials for troops. One of his superiors at the time was novelist Eric Ambler. It was he who gave Baker his first big break directing The October Man, from an Ambler screenplay, in 1947. Ambler also adapted Walter Lord's A Night to Remember for Baker's 1958 screen version.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Baker worked for three years in Hollywood where he directed Marilyn Monroe in Don't Bother to Knock (1952) and Robert Ryan in 3D film noir Inferno (1953). He returned to the UK for the latter part of the decade, but defected to television in the early 1960s.\n\nHe directed episodes of The Avengers, The Saint and The Champions - all adventure series created with an eye on the American market. The low-budget ethic of television production made him well-suited to his next career move into cheaply produced but lavish-looking British horror films. He directed, amongst others, Quatermass and the Pit (1967) The Vampire Lovers (1970) and Scars of Dracula (1970) for Hammer, and Asylum (1972) for Amicus.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1970s he returned to television, and throughout the 1980s continued to work in Television.  He retired in 1992.",

He was also among the postwar writer-directors who made some of their best films as they struggled to break free of industry censorship. His legacy is that of a filmmaker who sought independence in a collaborative art and tried to bring his own vision to the screen.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard Brooks, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMotoyoshi Oda (July 21, 1910; Moji City, Fukuoka \u2013 October 21, 1973; Tokyo) was a Japanese film director.\n\nAn English major who graduated from Waseda University, one of Japan's most prestigious, in 1935, Motoyoshi Oda was promptly accepted into the directors' program at Tokyo's P.C.L. (Photo Chemical Laboratories, a film company later incorporated into Toho Studios). He studied under director Satsuo Yamamoto, as did Akira Kurosawa, Ishir\u014d Honda, and Senkichi Taniguchi. When the latter two trainees were drafted into Japan's war in China, Oda found his career accelerated. He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya, after a relatively scant few years of training. Perhaps because of this relative lack of training, and certainly because Oda was not drafted into the army, P.C.L. and Toho kept Oda going as a maker of programmers - trivial pictures that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters, but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement.\n\nProbably his most distinguished credits are Lady From Hell (1949, based on a Kurosawa script), Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror classic inspired by The Invisible Man, a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man. The only film he made ever to be shown outside Japan was the second Godzilla film, Godzilla Raids Again (1955), released in the United States as Gigantis, the Fire Monster. Toho insisted that Oda direct as many as seven movies a year, knowing that he could be trusted to deliver them on time. Over his entire career, Motoyoshi Oda directed fifty movies, not to mention his work as assistant director and second-unit direction on Ishiro Honda's Eagle of the Pacific (1953). No credits are available for Oda during the last 15 years of his life, after 1958.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Motoyoshi Oda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Because of his interest in arts, he dropped out of Law School and entered the Painting Department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul. After graduating from the Academy, he did some painting works in workshops. His education in painting helped him when he was directing his movies, as he once remarked. In the beginning, he worked as a film critic, made paintings and wrote film scripts to earn a living. After co-directing two movies as an assistant director to Semih Evin in 1950, his directing career began with the film Kanli Feryat (The Bloody Cry). In 1960, he established his film company \"Yerli Film\" with the actor Orhan G\u00fcnsiray.\n\nThe most important movies in his filmography were: Hickirik (The Sob), Alageyik (The Fallow Deer), Suclu (The Guilty One), Seni Kaybedersem (If I Lose You), Yaban G\u00fcl\u00fc (The Wild Rose), Kesanli Ali Destani (Kesanli Ali's Epic), Tacsiz Kral (The Crownless King), Topragin Kani (Blood of the Earth), Olum Tarlasi (Death Field), Utanc (The Shame), Zavallilar (The Poor People), Selvi Boylum, Al Yazmalim (My Girl with the Red Scarf), Baskin (The Raid), Adak (The Sacrifice), Bir Yudum Sevgi (A Sip of Love), Adi Vasfiye (Her Name is Vasfiye), Berdel, D\u00fcs Gezginleri (Walking After Midnight), Eyl\u00fcl Firtinasi (After the Fall) and Mine.\n\nHe made movies that were both fluent and had mainly social messages. Most of the themes of his movies were taboo when they were produced. Particularly \"Mine\" and \"Her Name is Vasfiye\" were both revolutionary at the time of their release with themes regarding sexuality and the reaction of society.\n\nHe never gave up making movies throughout his life and even in the time when the industry stopped filmmaking due to economic reasons.\n\nAtif Yilmaz played an important role in the professional career of notable Turkish film directors like Halit Refig, Yilmaz G\u00fcney, Serif G\u00f6ren, Zeki \u00d6kten and Ali \u00d6zgent\u00fcrk.\n\nDuring the Antalya Film Festival in September 2005, he was admitted to hospital with gastro-intestinal complaints. He died on 5 May 2006 in Istanbul.\n\nIMDb mini bio by; yusufpiskin",

Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's Within the Woods, which served as a precursor to The Evil Dead.\n\nWhen Spiegel first moved to Los Angeles, he shared a house in with directors Raimi and Joel Coen, producer Ethan Coen and actresses Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand and Kathy Bates. He shared yet another house with roommate and film editor Bob Murawski (Spider-Man). In the early 1990s, he introduced film director Quentin Tarantino to producer Lawrence Bender, who helped Tarantino get Reservoir Dogs made.\n\nSpiegel grew up in what was then \"rural\" Birmingham, Michigan. He attended Walnut Lake Elementary school and then went on to attend West Maple Jr. High School. It was here that Scott met Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Spiegel worked at the local grocery market across from Walnut Lake Elementary School and it is from this market that Scott would later draw upon the memories to come up with classic scenes that would eventually be worked into many of the scenes of the movies he would either write or direct.\n\nIn 1999, Spiegel directed the direct-to-video sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn, Texas Blood Money. Spiegel formed the production company Raw Nerve with film directors Eli Roth, and Boaz Yakin. Raw Nerve produced the film Hostel (2005), directed by Roth.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Scott Spiegel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Sometimes described as \"multifaceted and chameleonic\"  due to his ability to switch tones and genres between movies, To is nonetheless seen as having a consistent style, which involves mixing subdued realism and social observation with highly stylized visual and acting elements.

He joined Makino Film Productions in 1929 as an assistant director and worked under Masahiro Makino. When that studio went bankrupt in 1932, he switched to Utaemon Ichikawa's production company and made his debut as a director in 1934 with Yumiya Hachiman Ken. He later moved to Toho, where he made comedies starring Enoken and even documentaries during the war. It was at Shintoho after the war that he became known for his cinematic adaptations of Japanese Kaidan, especially his masterful version of Tokaido Yotsuya Kaidan in 1959.\n\nTo Western audiences, his most famous film is Jigoku (1960), which he also co-wrote. The film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection in 2006.\n\nHe also filmed many Kaidan for television. His last film was 1982's Kaidan: Ikiteiru Koheiji.",

His most acclaimed feature, Gun Crazy (1949), is a dark romance about gun-obsession, and notable for its use of location photography.\n\nAt the dawn of his career (1937\u20131940), when Lewis was directing inexpensive westerns, he earned the derogatory nickname \"Wagon-Wheel Joe\" from the studio editors, because of his tendency to use wagon-wheels for constructing interesting visual compositions within the frame.\n\nLewis's offbeat and eye-catching compositions added style and value to inexpensive productions. His 1944 musical Minstrel Man, starring singer Benny Fields, is quite possibly the finest film ever made by low-budget PRC Pictures. Industry insiders noticed, prompting Columbia Pictures to hire Lewis to film the musical sequences for its blockbuster musical The Jolson Story.\n\nToward the end of Lewis's career, he worked in television, directing mostly westerns: The Rifleman, Bonanza, The Big Valley, Gunsmoke, and the pilot for Branded.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Joseph H.

    "biography": "Fernando Di Leo (11 January 1932 \u2013 2 December 2003) was an Italian film director and script writer. He made 17 films as a director and about 50 scripts from 1964 to 1985.\n\nFernando Di Leo was born on 11 January 1932 in San Ferdinando di Puglia. After briefly working in Rome's film school Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, di Leo made his debut as a director as part of the omnibus comedy Gli eroi di ieri, oggi, domani with his episode titled Un posto in paradiso (transl.\u2009A Place in Heaven). Following this Di Leo wrote several scripts for Westerns, often uncredited. This included work on A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More. Some of his Westerns had uncredited literary sources, such as Days of Vengeance which is loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nDi Leo was a fan of film noir and wanted to make an Italian version of these films. Among his first efforts was the script for Mino Guerrini's Date for a Murder based on Franco Enna's novel Tempo di massacro written in 1955. In Di Leo's version, the setting is moved to a contemporary Rome and has elements of contemporary spy films. Di Leo worked with Guerrini again on the film Gangsters '70 which did not do well at the box office. Di Leo began directing more of his own films at the time including the war film Red Roses for the Fuhrer and a few erotic films: A Woman on Fire, A Wrong Way to Love and Seduction. From 1969 to 1976, di Leo was able to produce many of his own works with his production company Duania cineproduzioni 70. He followed this with a return to noir with Naked Violence, a film adapting a novel by Giorgio Scerbanenco, a writer who Di Leo would adapt for several future film productions.\n\nDi Leo would make a giallo film with Slaughter Hotel starring Klaus Kinski and Margaret Lee. Following this Di Leo worked on Caliber 9 and The Italian Connection which were both inspired by the writing of Scerbanenco. He followed up this film Il Boss, a film which got Di Leo in trouble with politicians and authorities due to the film's display of connections between the mafia and Italy's major party Democrazia Cristiana. Di Leo followed this up with Shoot First, Die Later in 1974. Di Leo worked through the latter half of the 1970s directing Mister Scarface, Kidnap Syndicate, and Nick the Sting. He also wrote scripts for other directors such as Romolo Guerrieri's Young, Violent, Dangerous, and Ruggero Deodato's Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man. Di Leo's last film produced by his company Duania cineproduzioni 70 was Rulers of the City in 1976. He continued with a few more films after with the film noir Blood and Diamonds, the erotic drama To Be Twenty - both in 1978, and Madness in 1980.\n\nDi Leo worked in television in the 1980s, starting with the television series L'assassino ha le ore contate, which involved six one-hour-long made-for-TV films produced by RAI Uno which as of 2013 are unreleased. Di Leo also made The Violent Breed and his last film Killer vs. Killers in the mid-1980s. Killer vs. Killers wasn't released theatrically in Italy and only surfaced 20 years later on DVD.\n\nDi Leo died in December 2003.",

    "biography": "Noboru Iguchi is a Japanese film director, screenwriter and actor. He has worked as a director in adult video (AV) as well as in the horror and gore genres.\n\nIguchi was born on June 28, 1969. In an interview he said he was influenced in his work by the ghost houses and freak shows he went to as a child in Japanese play lands, and that his aim in his films is to both entertain and surprise.\n\nIn his extensive career as an AV director, Iguchi has worked for a number of studios including CineMagic, Big Morkal, Try-Heart, h.m.p and Soft On Demand (SOD). Nana Natsume and Risa Coda have been among the AV Idols featured in his videos. His videos have explored several of the typical Japanese AV genres, from incest for SOD to \"nakadashi\", bondage, group sex and some enema fetish videos for CineMagic.\n\nHis video Final Pussy starring Nana Natsume won the Best Rental Video Award at the 2005 SOD Awards. In this January 2005 video, Natsume's character (as the result of a military experiment gone wrong) has guns burst from her breasts when sexually aroused. The special makeup effects were by Yoshihiro Nishimura.\n\nOne of Iguchi's early movies was Kurushime-san (\u30af\u30eb\u30b7\u30e1\u3055\u3093) which was first released in 1997. Iguchi was screenwriter, editor, cinematographer and director of the black comedy-horror film which won the Encouragement Prize at the 1998 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival and starred Aki Arai, Miako Tadano and Tomoko Matsunashi.\n\nIn 2003, Iguchi wrote and directed the horror comedy A Larva to Love (\u604b\u3059\u308b\u5e7c\u866b, Koi-suru Y\u014dch\u016b) (with effects by Yoshihiro Nishimura) about a strange relationship involving a boy, a girl, and a parasite. Iguchi also wrote and directed the February 2006 film Sukeban Boy or Oira Sukeban (\u304a\u3044\u3089\u5973\u86ee \u30b9\u30b1\u30d0\u30f3, Oira sukeban) with AV star Asami. At an interview at the New York Asian Film Festival, Iguchi told of an incident where one of the actresses in the movie, completely unaware of her role, balked at doing action scenes totally naked. According to Iguchi \"We had to calm her down, capture her, and convince her to do the job ... We made it so she could not leave the set ... [in] America we would have been sued.\"\n\nLater in 2006, Iguchi directed Cat-Eyed Boy (\u732b\u76ee\u5c0f\u50e7, Nekome koz\u014d) based on the manga by Kazuo Umezu. The movie, with gravure idol Miku Ishida, Asami Kumakiri, Hiromasa Taguchi, Naoto Takenaka and Kanji Tsuda, was released theatrically in Japan in June 2006, and on DVD in October of the same year.\n\nIguchi was also both the screenwriter and director for the 2008 action and gore cult film The Machine Girl (\u7247\u8155\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb, Kataude mashin g\u0101ru) where he once again teamed up with Yoshihiro Nishimura who did the special effects and makeup effects. Iguchi said he wanted to make an action movie with a woman fighting and it started with just an idea of a girl losing her arm and going out for revenge and was originally called \"One Armed Big Busty Girl\" - the machine gun came later. Iguchi was a special guest at the 2009 and 2010 New York Asian Film Festival.\n\nIn 2010, Iguchi directed his largest-budgeted feature, the action film Karate-Robo Zaborgar, based on the popular 1970s television series Denjin Zaborger. He followed it with the scatological horror/comedy Zombie Ass in 2011.",

He achieved international attention for his award-winning short films early in his career, which led to him becoming a prolific television director with credits including the BBC costume drama The Way We Live Now, the acclaimed political thriller State of Play and the BAFTA-lauded two-part drama Sex Traffic. Due to the success of these dramas and subsequent projects, Yates is considered as one of Britain's most celebrated directors of film and television.\n\nHis work on the Harry Potter series brought him critical and commercial success along with accolades, such as the British Academy Britannia Award for Excellence in Directing.  Yates won the Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement for the six-part political thriller State of Play (2003).\n\nThroughout his works, Yates uses hand-held cameras to visually provoke the subject matter; the technique is noted as one of his directorial trademarks. Yates is married to Yvonne Walcott, who is the aunt of Arsenal football player Theo Walcott.",

    "biography": "Uchida started out at the Taikatsu studio in the early 1920s, but came to prominence at Nikkatsu, adapting literary works with the screenwriter Yasutar\u014d Yagi in a realist style. His 1929 film A Living Puppet (Ikeru ningyo) was selected as the fourth best film of the year by the film journal, Kinema Junpo. Many of his 1930s films featured the actor Isamu Kosugi. One such work, Policeman (Keisatsukan), has been called \"a tremendously stylish gangster movie about the love-hate relationship between a cop and a criminal, once childhood friends\" It is Uchida\u2019s only surviving complete silent film. Uchida borrows from Hollywood gangster films and expressionist techniques in a story of a young policeman tracking down an old friend who is now a criminal. His work from the 1920 and 1930s possess a leftist social commentary and were often some of the most critically acclaimed films of the time. Kinema Junpo selected Jinsei Gekijo as the number two film of 1936, Karininaki Zenshin as the best film of 1937, and Tsuchi as the best film of 1939. The latter was praised for its realistic depiction of the lives of poor Meiji-period tenant farmers. Unfortunately, few of Uchida's prewar works survive in their entirety.\n\nIn 1941, Uchida quit the Nikkatsu studio, and after failing to start his own production company, in 1943 began to work with the Manchukuo Film Association, although he never completed a film there. In 1945 he was taken prisoner and held in Manchuria until 1954, when he returned to Japan.\n\nUpon he return, he joined the Toei studio. His post-war movies reveal a strong genre stylist with no immediately discernible themes, much like many golden-age Hollywood directors. Uchida effortlessly directed chamber dramas, comedies, and samurai epics, often in color, and with a forward-looking dose of irony.",

He is most famous for directing early western films starring John Wayne in the 1930s, including Riders of Destiny (1933; an early singing cowboy movie), The Lucky Texan (1934), West of the Divide (1934), Blue Steel (1934), The Man From Utah (1934), The Star Packer (1934), The Trail Beyond (1934; co-starring Noah Beery, Sr. and Noah Beery, Jr.), The Lawless Frontier (1934), Texas Terror (1935), Rainbow Valley (1935), The Dawn Rider (1935), Westward Ho (1935), and Lawless Range (1935). These were inexpensively shot \"Poverty Row\" movies; many were also written by Bradbury and almost all of them featured character actor George \"Gabby\" Hayes. Bradbury also shot numerous similar films during this period starring his son Bob Steele or Johnny Mack Brown. Bradbury occasionally billed himself as \"Robert North Bradbury\", \"R.N. Bradbury\", or \"Robert Bradbury\".\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

There, he won the Princess Grace Award, the Dore Schary Award presented by the Anti-Defamation League, the Jack Nicholson directing award, and was recognized as an honoree for the IFP/West program Project: Involve.\n\nAfter making his student short, \"When the Kids Are Away\", Chu was signed to William Morris Agency and attached to several high profile projects. Chu was hired by Sony Pictures to direct their feature Bye Bye Birdie but Sony never green lit the film due to budget concerns. Sony recently got back into business with Chu to direct their updated version of The Great Gatsby. He also is in a dance crew called AC/DC or Adam/Chu Dance crew. His father, Lawrence Chu, is a well-known chef and his parents own Chef Chu's, a popular restaurant in Los Altos, California. He also attended Pinewood School from kindergarten through 12th grade. Chu is currently directing the online series The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.\n\nIn an interview, Chu addressed a question he is often asked, \"Why do all of your films have dance?\" He responded, \"I don\u2019t know why. It seems so obvious. But there\u2019s something about the dancers that motivate me the most. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just dance, but I do think that the dancers are amazing artists, and every time I meet a new dancer, that triggers something in my brain, and I\u2019m more creative than I could ever be. When I feel that creativity burst, I go with it.\"",

He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention. He subsequently appeared in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Osterman Weekend (1983), and received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He directed Colors (1988) and played the villain in Speed (1994). Hopper's later work included a leading role in the television series Crash. Hopper's last performance was filmed just before his death: The Last Film Festival, slated for a 2011 release. Hopper was also a prolific and acclaimed photographer, a profession he began in the 1960s.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

He then successfully ventured into direction with the 2005 Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, and the success of the project prompted further offers for Deva as a director.

Scott; the sports-themed film Vision Quest (1985); two musical videos for Madonna; the heavy drug drama The Boost (1988) again collaborating with Woods; and the neo-noir Sea of Love (1989) where he resurrected the career of Al Pacino.\n\nThe box-office suspense Malice (1993), the political thriller City Hall (1996) and the action Mercury Rising (1998) compose Becker's career in the 1990's directing big Hollywood stars and establishing him as one of the most versatile directors of the period.\n\nAfter the thriller Domestic Disturbance (2001) Becker never returned to film directing, possibly retired after not having many invitations to directed another feature.",

    "biography": "Richard Thorpe (February 24, 1896 - May 1, 1991) was an American film director. Born Rollo Smolt Thorpe in Hutchinson, Kansas, he began his entertainment career performing in vaudeville and onstage. In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. The first full length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. After directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry. He died in Palm Springs, California in 1991.\n\nThorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting, because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about thirteen. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe's work on the film survive today.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
